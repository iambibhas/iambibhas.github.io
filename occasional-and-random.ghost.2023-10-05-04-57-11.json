(Kickstarter)\n\nThe HAT is primarily for a Pi Zero, but it works with any Raspberry Pi with 40 GPIO pins, hence my Pi 1 B+ qualifies.\n\nI've had this Pi for years now and it was gathering dust. So recently decided to pick it up and do something with it. First I set up a Pi-hole instance on it and then a Telegraf+Influxdb+Grafana instance to monitor my home Internet connection. Then found that I also had a BBC Micro:bit lying around and it comes with a bunch of sensors built in. So thought if I could connect the Micro:bit with the RPi, then I could use the sensors to monitor my home temperature real time for example. The other option is to get a temperature sensor for the Pi. But let's call that plan B.\n\nBut the Micro:bit doesn't come with any GPIO interface. The connectors are weird. I need to buy a separate breakout shield and then get a breadboard to connect to it. I thought why not use the BLE on board of Micro:bit to connect to it. And I happened to have a RedBear IoT pHAT lying around as well which I could connect to the RPi1 and make it Bluetooth enabled.\n\nSo, I connected it. Wi-Fi worked fine. But Bluetooth showed no sign of working. RPi couldn't initialize the Bluetooth controller.\n\npi@raspberrypi:~ $ sudo systemctl status hciuart.service\n● hciuart.service - Configure Bluetooth Modems connected by UART\n   Loaded: loaded (/lib/systemd/system/hciuart.service; enabled; vendor preset: enabled)\n   Active: inactive (dead)\n\nJul 13 11:56:50 raspberrypi systemd[1]: Dependency failed for Configure Bluetooth Modems connected by UART.\nJul 13 11:56:50 raspberrypi systemd[1]: hciuart.service: Job hciuart.service/start failed with result 'dependency'.\n\nSo this followed hours of digging. From updating the Linux kernel to updating all the Bluetooth related packages. Nothing worked. Because I assumed that the pHAT h/w was fine and it'll just work. When no software changes worked, I started looking at the h/w. Went through the older issues of the pHAT repo, just to find this 4 year old issue.\n\nBluetooth not working · Issue #2 · redbear/IoT_pHATSometimes, the Bluetooth fails to load when booting up. The current method to resolve: https://github.com/redbear/IoT_pHAT/tree/master/eeprom/experimental But still need to add init_uart_clock=4800...GitHubredbear\n\nApparently I could update the EEPROM firmware of the pHAT.

The bluetoothctl can now find the controller and I can scan for devices. 😊\n\npi@raspberrypi:~ $ sudo bluetoothctl\n[NEW] Controller B8:27:EB:5C:DA:1D raspberrypi [default]\n[bluetooth]# show\nController XX:27:EB:XX:DA:XX\n\tName: raspberrypi\n\tAlias: raspberrypi\n\tClass: 0x000000\n\tPowered: yes\n\tDiscoverable: no\n\tPairable: yes\n\tUUID: Generic Attribute Profile (00001801-0000-1000-8000-00805f9b34fb)\n\tUUID: A/V Remote Control        (0000110e-0000-1000-8000-00805f9b34fb)\n\tUUID: PnP Information           (00001200-0000-1000-8000-00805f9b34fb)\n\tUUID: Generic Access Profile    (00001800-0000-1000-8000-00805f9b34fb)\n\tUUID: A/V Remote Control Target (0000110c-0000-1000-8000-00805f9b34fb)\n\tModalias: usb:v1D6Bp0246d052B\n\tDiscovering: no\n\nI still cannot connect to the Micro:bit to read the sensors though.

To monitor any downtime, we use Uptime Robot. For last few days, uptime robot has been sending out alerts now and then that Hasjob was going down 10-15 minutes as a time. But when I visited the home page, it was working, even when uptime robot was reporting it to be down. So I thought it might be some issue that's affecting some requests and not the others. I looked into the logs but couldn't find anything meaningful. Except one expensive query that we run, which is supposed to be async. We pushed a fix for it yesterday morning, which was supposed to make things better. But suddenly we started getting complaints that the job posts were not loading at all. I go and check. The home page was loading but none of the job posts were. It was 9:43PM on a Friday night, but we had to fix it. So I started digging in.\n\nFirst observation from uwsgi log was that every request to a jobpost page was taking 30+ seconds to load. Every single one of them. Some were taking 60-90 seconds. So we now know that Nginx is giving up on waiting for uwsgi requests because uwsgi is taking too much time to respond.\n\nMy first hunch was the expensive query. We recently upgrade to Postgres 12. I saw that logging wasn't turned on, so I turned it on for expensive queries. It was logging the expensive queries, but after some observation, found no correlation between them and the HTTP requests. There were more requests that were timing out, than expensive queries. So that's out the window.\n\nSo it's most likely the application taking time to respond. But we didn't make any changes to the application recently that could affect application response time this much. Something else must suddenly be taking too much time. That's where I decided to profile the requests. We don't use Newrelic or any other service that runs a profiler on each request. That's something we are going to do after last night I think.\n\nAnyway, Hasjob is a flask application that runs on uwsgi. So I look into how to put a profiler in between. Went through a bunch of Python profiler packages and none of them seem to fit in my use case. I needed something simple and plug-and-play to run the profiler on a production application. After some scrambling I stumbled upon werkzeug's ProfilerMiddleware. We already use werkzeug because of Flask, so this seemed perfect.\n\nOur wsgi file looked like this -\n\n# -*- coding: utf-8 -*-\nimport os.path\nimport sys\n\nfrom hasjob import app as application\n\n__all__ = ['application']\n\nsys.path.insert(0, os.path.dirname(__file__))\n\nNow I updated to this -\n\n# -*- coding: utf-8 -*-\nimport os.path\nimport sys\nfrom werkzeug.middleware.profiler import ProfilerMiddleware\n\nfrom hasjob import app as application\n\napplication.config['PROFILE'] = True\napplication.wsgi_app = ProfilerMiddleware(\n    application.wsgi_app, \n    restrictions=[5], \n    profile_dir='/path/to/profiler/directory'\n)\n\n__all__ = ['application']\n\nsys.path.insert(0, os.path.dirname(__file__))\n\nrestrictions says that show only top 5 issues, and profile_dir says to log all the profiles in the provided directory. I didn't turn off stream output so at the same time the profiler was spitting out the outputs in uwsgi log.\n\nAnd with much amaze I see that all the requests were going through 19-38 time.sleep calls that were delaying them. Which was confusing as hell. So something was definitely blocking the application. My guess once again was an expensive query. Now to look into what exactly was blocking the application.\n\nThe most popular solution to analyse the profile files I came across was to use gprof2dot to turn the profile files into dot files. And then use graphviz to turn that dot file into a graphical representation of all the method calls. They look something like this.\n\nSo I install gprof2dot convert one profile file and transfer it to my laptop. I didn't know how much time or processing power it'll require. I install graphviz on my laptop and start processing the dot file at around 12AM. By the time you reach the end of the blog post, it was 1:30AM and that file was still processing. I gave up around 12:20 AM. It was Friday night and every minute some user was getting timed out.\n\nI started looking into how else to analyse it. And came across pstats. Let's give this a try.\n\nimport pstats\nstats = pstats.Stats('directory/GET.foobar.000255ms.1392663371.prof')\nstats.sort_stats('time', 'calls')\nstats.print_callers('time.sleep')\n\nJust to find that the caller of time.sleep is -\n\n<path_to_venv>/lib/python3.7/site-packages/eventlet/hubs/poll.py:71(wait)\n\nI'm like, \"Ok..\", but why? So I check the caller of above, just to find this -\n\n<path_to_venv>/lib/python3.7/site-packages/dns/resolver.py:972(resolve)\n\nAnd I'm like, \"Ehhh....!!\" This is what was left?\n\nI boot up a Python shell and try this -\n\n>>> import dns.resolver\n>>> resolver = dns.resolver.Resolver()\n>>> resolver.timeout = 30\n>>> resolver.lifetime = 30\n>>> resolver.query('bibhasdn.com', 'MX')\nTraceback (most recent call last):\n  File \"<input>\", line 1, in <module>\n    resolver.query('bibhasdn.com', 'MX')\n  File \"/<path_to_venv>/lib/python3.7/site-packages/dns/resolver.py\", l\nine 1091, in query\n    True)\n  File \"/<path_to_venv>/lib/python3.7/site-packages/dns/resolver.py\", l\nine 1043, in resolve\n    timeout = self._compute_timeout(start, lifetime)\n  File \"/<path_to_venv>/lib/python3.7/site-packages/dns/resolver.py\", l\nine 950, in _compute_timeout\n    raise Timeout(timeout=duration)\ndns.exception.Timeout: The DNS operation timed out after 31.13741111755371 seconds\n\nI'm like, \"Really?\"\n\nAfter a few more print_callers() calls I find out the root of the issue. We use this library called mxsniff that checks if an email address is from a public email domain. We forgot to add a cache for each domain checks, so it was making DNS queries on every request. DNS queries were timing out and so were the requests.\n\nNow to look into why the DNS queries were timing out. I go look into the github repository dnspython that provides dns.resolver.  Just to find this -\n\nEventlet &lt;= 0.26.0 incompatible with dnspython &gt;= 2.0.0 · Issue #559 · rthalley/dnspythonUsers of eventlet &lt;= 0.25.2 should pin dnspython to 1.16.0.

This quote is from <a href=\"https://internetfreedom.in/explainer-whatsapp-privacy-policy-changes-2021/\">the explainer</a> posted by <a href=\"https://internetfreedom.in/\">Internet Freedom Foundation</a> -</p><blockquote>Recently, WhatsApp released an in-app notification forcing users to accept its revised privacy policy by 08 February 2021 or stop using its service entirely. The new privacy policy confirms that Facebook may now have access to messages shared with businesses on WhatsApp and it provides more insight into expansive meta data collection by WhatsApp. The latest changes to WhatsApp’s privacy policy cement the problematic status quo which has existed since the privacy policy was first updated in 2016.</blockquote><p>What IFF is mentioning there is <a href=\"https://blog.whatsapp.com/setting-the-record-straight/?lang=en\">the statement by WhatsApp</a> when they were acquired by Facebook in 2014. This is what they said back then -</p><blockquote>If partnering with Facebook meant that we had to change our values, we wouldn’t have done it. Instead, we are forming a partnership that would allow us to continue operating independently and autonomously. Our fundamental values and beliefs will not change. Our principles will not change. Everything that has made WhatsApp the leader in personal messaging will still be in place. Speculation to the contrary isn’t just baseless and unfounded, it’s irresponsible. It has the effect of scaring people into thinking we’re suddenly collecting all kinds of new data. That’s just not true, and it’s important to us that you know that.</blockquote><p>The prompt billions of WhatsApp users received on that morning goes against everything that was promised. So this set off an alarm.</p><h3 id=\"the-burning-matchstick-\">The burning matchstick -</h3><p>People started to talk more about this. A lot of people accepted this prompt without reading because we're not used to reading terms and conditions. But then later they realised what just happened, and they also got angry.

My contacts who are usually the farthest from what you'd call a \"Techie\", started joining Signal. All in the search for \"privacy\". This set off a series of conversations in many groups I'm in because most of the people I talk to are techies, and we've been Signal users for years. We've never been able to use it as a regular messaging app because none of our other contacts were using it. But we still had it with us all the time, just in case we needed to have a private chat.</p><p>What's interesting about this mass immigration to Signal is that people are talking more and more about what \"privacy\" means on the Internet. So what if we leave WhatsApp, when we join Signal/Telegram they'll have our data, right? What's so different about it? How does it even matter? Some people started saying that if you move from WhatsApp and still use Instagram, that's just plain hypocrisy. Because of course Instagram is also owned by Facebook. And it's arguably more data hungry.</p><p>I had these conversations many a time with many people over the years. So I thought I'll just write about how I see it, what \"privacy\" means to me, what \"privacy\" looks like on the Internet, and how I try to protect my privacy on the Internet.</p><p>Before I get to what \"privacy\" means to me, I want to talk a bit about \"Facebook\". First of all, if you didn't know, Facebook is primarily an advertising company. The only way Facebook makes money is by selling you ads. That's it. At this point, I'd request you to go through this Twitter thread that talks a bit about what Facebook is - </p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-embed-card\"><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-width=\"550\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Stephen, why are you so critical of Facebook and not the other big tech companies?<br><br>A 🧵 for well-intentioned engineers about how to navigate the complexities of big tech.</p>&mdash; Stephen Diehl (@smdiehl) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/smdiehl/status/1345677279322636293?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">January 3, 2021</a></blockquote>\n<script async src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script>\n</figure><p>This is the relevant part about Facebook - </p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"__GHOST_URL__/content/images/2021/01/Screen-Shot-2021-01-12-at-11.20.47-PM.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1216\" height=\"1200\" srcset=\"__GHOST_URL__/content/images/size/w600/2021/01/Screen-Shot-2021-01-12-at-11.20.47-PM.png 600w, __GHOST_URL__/content/images/size/w1000/2021/01/Screen-Shot-2021-01-12-at-11.20.47-PM.png 1000w, __GHOST_URL__/content/images/2021/01/Screen-Shot-2021-01-12-at-11.20.47-PM.png 1216w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 720px) 720px\"><figcaption>Facebook</figcaption></figure><p>And that's about it. No, Facebook is not just a website to post about your day, your trips, your food etc. To you, you may use it just for that, but what Facebook does, is to take everything you post, and turn them into data that can be used to show more ads to you or somebody else. Every single thing you post, is linked to you, people of your gender, age group, ethnicity, country, etc etc and then more relevant ads are served to them. That's entirely what Facebook does to make money. And that's also how Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp are free.</p><p>Facebook is not just another company. The company literally has no moral compass. It'll do anything to make money. Even if it means literally<a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2020/12/with-the-election-over-facebook-gets-back-to-spreading-misinformation\"> poisoning your mind with misinformation</a>, or <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/2014/10/facebook-wont-stop-experimenting-just-lucrative/\">experiment with you</a> to see what kind of posts make you more angry. And you also literally can't quit Facebook. Even if you delete your account, Facebook has said that <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2018/4/11/17225482/facebook-shadow-profiles-zuckerberg-congress-data-privacy\">it'll still keep tracking you</a>. That's how worse they are.</p><p>And that's about what I know about Facebook. And these are all facts.</p><p>But I still have an Instagram account. Even though I barely use it. I still have them. But why? If I cared about my privacy, wouldn't I delete it right away?</p><p>This is where the definition of \"privacy\" comes in -</p><blockquote>Privacy is the ability of an individual or group to seclude themselves or information about themselves, and thereby express themselves selectively. When something is private to a person, it usually means that something is inherently special or sensitive to them.</blockquote><p>The key phrase here is \"the ability of an individual or group to seclude themselves or information about themselves\". Having privacy means having a choice to seclude yourself or the data about yourself. It can be in real life, and on the Internet similarly. Just as living your daily life doesn't mean you must give up your privacy, in the same way, just using the Internet doesn't mean that you must give up your privacy. I use Instagram from their website and not the app. So Instagram only gets the data I share. It can't snoop on my phone without my knowledge.</p><p>This is why companies like Facebook deploys all their time and money into deceiving you to share as much data about you as possible. To a point where you start thinking that there is no point keeping things to yourself anymore. Or rather, it's <em>good</em> to share everything about yourself with everyone on the internet/or the platform, because that's the normal thing to do.</p><p>I have people asking me if I'm actively hating Facebook but still using X or Y company, doesn't that make me a hypocrite? There is a good chance you'll face the same question as well if you go down this path. But that's a dangerous line of thought. What they essentially mean by that is, if you use the Internet, then your privacy is compromised. If you stop using Facebook, you must also stop using X/Y company. But that's the real life equivalent of leaving the civilization, and going and living in the woods to protect your privacy. You can be that kind of extremist, but I won't recommend it. To me privacy is being able to choose what I share and with whom I share it. Just like in real life you may trust one person with your secret but not another, similarly you should be able to choose X company with your data, but not trust Facebook (seriously, Facebook is horrible).</p><h3 id=\"decentralization-\">Decentralization -</h3><p>When you start thinking like that, a plethora of options open up for you. And you also stumble upon this concept called \"Decentralization of data\". Just as they say, \"Don't put all your eggs in one basket\". Same way, don't share all your data with one company. Your data is more valuable when they can be linked to each other. The moment you decentralize, your value to these companies suddenly go down, and they stop making as much money from you as before.</p><p>But how does \"decentralization of data\" looks like on the Internet? That's exactly what people are doing by moving away from WhatsApp right now. Suddenly Facebook has no idea who you're talking to, at what time, from where etc. The value of your data just reduced a little to Facebook. It'll become minimal when you stop using all products by Facebook, but one step at a time.</p><h3 id=\"signal-\">Signal -</h3><p>When you move away from WhatsApp in search for private chat, that's where Signal comes into the picture. If you think Signal is just another messaging app, just like WhatsApp, you'd be wrong. Signal was created to let you chat privately with anyone. The only reason they exist is to let you have a conversation privately. But how do they do it? How do you trust that they're not taking your data like WhatsApp? It's easier in this case. Signal is completely open source. And thousands of people over the last half decade has audited their code and helped them weed out vulnerabilities. That's the power of open source.</p><p>I've heard this question by some people that if a software is open source, wont it get hacker more easily? That could be true if the software's code was made open just now and nobody has seen it. But in general open source software are more reliable <em>because</em> people can read their code. There are more eyes on the code,  which means more bugs are reported and fixed. The software gets hardened in the process. </p><p>So how does Signal keep your data private? They implement something called end-to-end encryption, ELI5 version of which is that, only you and the person you're talking to will have the keys to the encrypted data. So even if the data is saved by Signal, they'll never be able to read it. That's just how it works. There is a newbie friendly explanation of it <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/signal-encryption-protocol-hacker-lexicon/\">at Wired</a>. You can read more about the Signal protocol on <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signal_Protocol\">their wiki page</a>.</p><p>WhatsApp says that they've also implemented the Signal protocol themselves for your data. But they still have access to the \"metadata\" for your conversations which they keep. \"Metadata\" means all the information about your conversations. Like -</p><ul><li>when you're online (this can indicate when you wake up, when you sleep, when you work),</li><li>who you're talking to, </li><li>when you talked to them (this can easily indicate your intimate relationships, and they already know who you're talking to), </li><li>how much you talk to someone,</li><li>from which location (this can easily indicate where you live, when you're home or not), </li><li>which business you're buying something from (this is dangerous as our shopping habits tell a lot about us, like, if you're talking to MakeMyTrip, then you're traveling soon etc),</li><li>using what handset model (this can give idea about your wealth level), </li><li>using what operating system etc. </li></ul><p>And that information in itself is valuable. A lot can be known about you from all of that. And hence WhatsApp keeps this data, and sells it to other companies to show somebody (could be yourself) more ad somewhere. Because that's the only way they earn money.</p><p>Signal avoid a lot of this by design. For example - </p><ul><li><a href=\"https://signal.org/blog/private-contact-discovery/\">Signal never uploads your address book to their server</a>. Instead, the Signal app calculates a SHA256 hash of each phone number, and then checks that against the hashes of all registered users. Hence avoiding creating a social graph of you that can be sold to someone. If you think that Signal could somehow extract the phone numbers out of the hashes and use that, why would they go into all that trouble when apparently people give away their address book to apps like Facebook and Instagram without a second thought?</li><li>Signal Protocol also encrypts the \"metadata\" of your messages by design. The stuff that makes WhatsApp money, Signal can't even access it.</li></ul><p>Also, according to the new privacy policy of WhatsApp, if you chat with a business, that conversation won't even be encrypted. WhatsApp is free to see what you're talking to a business about. When you think of it, it makes sense. The only reason you'd talk to a business is if you're buying something. And having access to that data makes it easier to show you more ads.</p><p>This is a nice chart that shows how much data some apps have about you - </p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-width-full\"><img src=\"__GHOST_URL__/content/images/2021/01/0imry50rxy961.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1920\" height=\"1102\" srcset=\"__GHOST_URL__/content/images/size/w600/2021/01/0imry50rxy961.png 600w, __GHOST_URL__/content/images/size/w1000/2021/01/0imry50rxy961.png 1000w, __GHOST_URL__/content/images/size/w1600/2021/01/0imry50rxy961.png 1600w, __GHOST_URL__/content/images/2021/01/0imry50rxy961.png 1920w\"></figure><p>They collect the same or more data from Instagram as well BTW. Instagram app has been accused of listening to your conversations all the time and then suggesting you ads based on what you talk about.</p><p>Signal avoids all that by design. You see, technology to protect your privacy exists. They just don't make enough money for most companies. So they don't use them. You have to seek the tools out that protects your privacy.</p><h3 id=\"there-s-an-app-for-that-\">There's an app for that -</h3><p>This is a good spot to be aware of the apps and websites you use and how they treat your data. Because we're talking about trusting each app/website individually, you should be conscious about what data you share with each of them. For example, when you use a website, the website only gets the data the browser is able to share with your permission - your IP address, your browser version, your geo-location (they'll have to ask you for it first), your Internet service provider etc. Not a lot more. But when you use the same company's app, they instantly get access to a lot more. Which is why almost every other website asks you to install their app. Some companies even reduce functionalities of their mobile website so that you are forced to install their app (Yes, I'm looking at you Zomato).</p><p>But there are still some companies that are acting considerate and lets you use their mobile website almost at par with their app. E.g. Instagram, Ola, Scripbox etc. And a lot more. When you open a site on your mobile browser, look for the \"Add to home page\" button for that website. It's a technique called Progressive Web App (PWA) that lets you run a browser tab as a standalone app. And it still abides by the permission provided by the browser.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"__GHOST_URL__/content/images/2021/01/photo_2021-01-13_09-04-58.jpg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1080\" height=\"820\" srcset=\"__GHOST_URL__/content/images/size/w600/2021/01/photo_2021-01-13_09-04-58.jpg 600w, __GHOST_URL__/content/images/size/w1000/2021/01/photo_2021-01-13_09-04-58.jpg 1000w, __GHOST_URL__/content/images/2021/01/photo_2021-01-13_09-04-58.jpg 1080w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 720px) 720px\"></figure><p>But as we cannot avoid installing the apps sometime, we need to be vigilant about it. Don't install apps that -</p><ul><li>have low rating on the app store</li><li>build by a developer who looks shady or has a bad history</li><li>relies heavily on ads without a way to turn them off, which could be by buying the app</li><li>asks for permissions that are unnecessary to the functionality of the app. E.g. - Why does the Hotstar app need access to your camera, contacts, location, microphone, and also see a list of the other apps you have installed? You just want to watch your favorite series. Do you really have to give away this much data just for that?</li></ul><p>It's good that a lot more people are talking about privacy now. And the discussions should include these questions. If you reject these malpractices of these apps, they <em>will</em> change. They do these things because we're OK with them.</p><h3 id=\"ads-ads-everywhere-\">Ads, ads, everywhere -</h3><p>One topic related to Facebook that shows up a lot, is advertisements. Ads are the bane of the Internet. To such a level that the brightest minds of our time are being paid toppest dollar just to figure out how to show you more relevant ads. </p><p>Ads don't just tell you about an irrelevant product you don't want to buy, they also track you. They track that you saw that ad, from where, at what time, from what IP address, and if they can link you to your account details, then they link all that data to your demographic, as in, that people who look like you, of your gender, of your ethnicity, of your age group, saw that ad at that time. And if you click it, they link all your demographic data with that click, saying that the ad was successful in getting a click in demographic. Yay.</p><p>To understand why ads are bad, and why Facebook puts so much money in it, you should probably know that ads don't just tell you what to buy, ads also decide how you think about something. Be it ads on TV, radio or the Internet. Ads exist to manipulate you, to think in a certain way. </p><p>You know how breakfast is the most important meal of the day? Guess what? <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2016/nov/28/breakfast-health-america-kellog-food-lifestyle\">It actually isn't.</a> It was a group of lobbyists who needed to sell more sugary cereal that printed ads everywhere in 19th century that actually made people believe this lie. And we're still buy corn flakes covered in sugar thinking it actually is a healthy breakfast choice. Also, no. Complan/Horlicks wont make you taller, stronger, and sharper. They're also mostly sugar.</p><p>Similar examples are everywhere. No, using fairness cream doesn't make you successful in life. No, using that particular brand of paint doesn't save your house from rain. No, using that detergent doesn't make your clothes more white than others. No, that brand of oil is not healthier than the other brands of same oil. No, despite what ads show you all the time, mothers don't belong in the kitchen. Yet, ads have been successful for decades in making us believe all that. You'd still buy a brand name that you've heard most. You'd still buy fairness cream because it gives you confidence, as ads have made you believe. And women can't seem to get rid of the stereotype of belonging in kitchen for some reason. <em>hint hint </em>(This is a broad topic, but do keep an eye on how our media/ads portray traditional gender roles around us)</p><p>We believe what we see around us. If you continuously see posts and ads that says X is good/bad, you're more likely to believe it even if you don't realize why. Most of us humans are driven by trends. We're more likely to believe what our social circle is talking about, without thinking critically about it.</p><p>These are all examples of TV/radio ads. It's even worse when it comes to online ads. Because almost anyone can post ads anywhere online for very little money. And can manipulate you however they want. Facebook, for years, has <a href=\"https://www.vice.com/en/article/n7w8zd/how-facebook-allows-misinformation-to-spread-even-after-its-flagged\">actively denied taking down ads that spread misinformation to manipulate people</a>.

This quote is from the explainer posted by Internet Freedom Foundation -\n\nRecently, WhatsApp released an in-app notification forcing users to accept its revised privacy policy by 08 February 2021 or stop using its service entirely. The new privacy policy confirms that Facebook may now have access to messages shared with businesses on WhatsApp and it provides more insight into expansive meta data collection by WhatsApp. The latest changes to WhatsApp’s privacy policy cement the problematic status quo which has existed since the privacy policy was first updated in 2016.\n\nWhat IFF is mentioning there is the statement by WhatsApp when they were acquired by Facebook in 2014. This is what they said back then -\n\nIf partnering with Facebook meant that we had to change our values, we wouldn’t have done it. Instead, we are forming a partnership that would allow us to continue operating independently and autonomously. Our fundamental values and beliefs will not change. Our principles will not change. Everything that has made WhatsApp the leader in personal messaging will still be in place. Speculation to the contrary isn’t just baseless and unfounded, it’s irresponsible. It has the effect of scaring people into thinking we’re suddenly collecting all kinds of new data. That’s just not true, and it’s important to us that you know that.\n\nThe prompt billions of WhatsApp users received on that morning goes against everything that was promised. So this set off an alarm.\n\n\nThe burning matchstick -\n\nPeople started to talk more about this. A lot of people accepted this prompt without reading because we're not used to reading terms and conditions. But then later they realised what just happened, and they also got angry. The last straw was this tweet -\n\nThus began the great WhatsApp exodus.\n\n\nPrivacy and Facebook -\n\nPeople who've never heard of Signal, started joining it. My contacts who are usually the farthest from what you'd call a \"Techie\", started joining Signal. All in the search for \"privacy\". This set off a series of conversations in many groups I'm in because most of the people I talk to are techies, and we've been Signal users for years. We've never been able to use it as a regular messaging app because none of our other contacts were using it. But we still had it with us all the time, just in case we needed to have a private chat.\n\nWhat's interesting about this mass immigration to Signal is that people are talking more and more about what \"privacy\" means on the Internet. So what if we leave WhatsApp, when we join Signal/Telegram they'll have our data, right? What's so different about it? How does it even matter? Some people started saying that if you move from WhatsApp and still use Instagram, that's just plain hypocrisy. Because of course Instagram is also owned by Facebook. And it's arguably more data hungry.\n\nI had these conversations many a time with many people over the years. So I thought I'll just write about how I see it, what \"privacy\" means to me, what \"privacy\" looks like on the Internet, and how I try to protect my privacy on the Internet.\n\nBefore I get to what \"privacy\" means to me, I want to talk a bit about \"Facebook\". First of all, if you didn't know, Facebook is primarily an advertising company. The only way Facebook makes money is by selling you ads. That's it. At this point, I'd request you to go through this Twitter thread that talks a bit about what Facebook is -\n\nStephen, why are you so critical of Facebook and not the other big tech companies?\n\nA 🧵 for well-intentioned engineers about how to navigate the complexities of big tech.\n\n— Stephen Diehl (@smdiehl) January 3, 2021\n\n\n\nThis is the relevant part about Facebook -\n\nAnd that's about it. No, Facebook is not just a website to post about your day, your trips, your food etc. To you, you may use it just for that, but what Facebook does, is to take everything you post, and turn them into data that can be used to show more ads to you or somebody else. Every single thing you post, is linked to you, people of your gender, age group, ethnicity, country, etc etc and then more relevant ads are served to them. That's entirely what Facebook does to make money. And that's also how Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp are free.\n\nFacebook is not just another company. The company literally has no moral compass. It'll do anything to make money. Even if it means literally poisoning your mind with misinformation, or experiment with you to see what kind of posts make you more angry. And you also literally can't quit Facebook. Even if you delete your account, Facebook has said that it'll still keep tracking you. That's how worse they are.\n\nAnd that's about what I know about Facebook. And these are all facts.\n\nBut I still have an Instagram account. Even though I barely use it. I still have them. But why? If I cared about my privacy, wouldn't I delete it right away?\n\nThis is where the definition of \"privacy\" comes in -\n\nPrivacy is the ability of an individual or group to seclude themselves or information about themselves, and thereby express themselves selectively. When something is private to a person, it usually means that something is inherently special or sensitive to them.\n\nThe key phrase here is \"the ability of an individual or group to seclude themselves or information about themselves\". Having privacy means having a choice to seclude yourself or the data about yourself. It can be in real life, and on the Internet similarly. Just as living your daily life doesn't mean you must give up your privacy, in the same way, just using the Internet doesn't mean that you must give up your privacy. I use Instagram from their website and not the app. So Instagram only gets the data I share. It can't snoop on my phone without my knowledge.\n\nThis is why companies like Facebook deploys all their time and money into deceiving you to share as much data about you as possible. To a point where you start thinking that there is no point keeping things to yourself anymore. Or rather, it's good to share everything about yourself with everyone on the internet/or the platform, because that's the normal thing to do.\n\nI have people asking me if I'm actively hating Facebook but still using X or Y company, doesn't that make me a hypocrite? There is a good chance you'll face the same question as well if you go down this path. But that's a dangerous line of thought. What they essentially mean by that is, if you use the Internet, then your privacy is compromised. If you stop using Facebook, you must also stop using X/Y company. But that's the real life equivalent of leaving the civilization, and going and living in the woods to protect your privacy. You can be that kind of extremist, but I won't recommend it. To me privacy is being able to choose what I share and with whom I share it. Just like in real life you may trust one person with your secret but not another, similarly you should be able to choose X company with your data, but not trust Facebook (seriously, Facebook is horrible).\n\n\nDecentralization -\n\nWhen you start thinking like that, a plethora of options open up for you. And you also stumble upon this concept called \"Decentralization of data\". Just as they say, \"Don't put all your eggs in one basket\". Same way, don't share all your data with one company. Your data is more valuable when they can be linked to each other. The moment you decentralize, your value to these companies suddenly go down, and they stop making as much money from you as before.\n\nBut how does \"decentralization of data\" looks like on the Internet? That's exactly what people are doing by moving away from WhatsApp right now. Suddenly Facebook has no idea who you're talking to, at what time, from where etc. The value of your data just reduced a little to Facebook. It'll become minimal when you stop using all products by Facebook, but one step at a time.\n\n\nSignal -\n\nWhen you move away from WhatsApp in search for private chat, that's where Signal comes into the picture. If you think Signal is just another messaging app, just like WhatsApp, you'd be wrong. Signal was created to let you chat privately with anyone. The only reason they exist is to let you have a conversation privately. But how do they do it? How do you trust that they're not taking your data like WhatsApp? It's easier in this case. Signal is completely open source. And thousands of people over the last half decade has audited their code and helped them weed out vulnerabilities. That's the power of open source.\n\nI've heard this question by some people that if a software is open source, wont it get hacker more easily? That could be true if the software's code was made open just now and nobody has seen it. But in general open source software are more reliable because people can read their code. There are more eyes on the code,  which means more bugs are reported and fixed. The software gets hardened in the process.\n\nSo how does Signal keep your data private? They implement something called end-to-end encryption, ELI5 version of which is that, only you and the person you're talking to will have the keys to the encrypted data. So even if the data is saved by Signal, they'll never be able to read it. That's just how it works. There is a newbie friendly explanation of it at Wired. You can read more about the Signal protocol on their wiki page.\n\nWhatsApp says that they've also implemented the Signal protocol themselves for your data. But they still have access to the \"metadata\" for your conversations which they keep. \"Metadata\" means all the information about your conversations. Like -\n\n * when you're online (this can indicate when you wake up, when you sleep, when you work),\n * who you're talking to,\n * when you talked to them (this can easily indicate your intimate relationships, and they already know who you're talking to),\n * how much you talk to someone,\n * from which location (this can easily indicate where you live, when you're home or not),\n * which business you're buying something from (this is dangerous as our shopping habits tell a lot about us, like, if you're talking to MakeMyTrip, then you're traveling soon etc),\n * using what handset model (this can give idea about your wealth level),\n * using what operating system etc.\n\nAnd that information in itself is valuable. A lot can be known about you from all of that. And hence WhatsApp keeps this data, and sells it to other companies to show somebody (could be yourself) more ad somewhere. Because that's the only way they earn money.\n\nSignal avoid a lot of this by design. For example -\n\n * Signal never uploads your address book to their server. Instead, the Signal app calculates a SHA256 hash of each phone number, and then checks that against the hashes of all registered users. Hence avoiding creating a social graph of you that can be sold to someone. If you think that Signal could somehow extract the phone numbers out of the hashes and use that, why would they go into all that trouble when apparently people give away their address book to apps like Facebook and Instagram without a second thought?\n * Signal Protocol also encrypts the \"metadata\" of your messages by design. The stuff that makes WhatsApp money, Signal can't even access it.\n\nAlso, according to the new privacy policy of WhatsApp, if you chat with a business, that conversation won't even be encrypted. WhatsApp is free to see what you're talking to a business about. When you think of it, it makes sense. The only reason you'd talk to a business is if you're buying something. And having access to that data makes it easier to show you more ads.\n\nThis is a nice chart that shows how much data some apps have about you -\n\nThey collect the same or more data from Instagram as well BTW. Instagram app has been accused of listening to your conversations all the time and then suggesting you ads based on what you talk about.\n\nSignal avoids all that by design. You see, technology to protect your privacy exists. They just don't make enough money for most companies. So they don't use them. You have to seek the tools out that protects your privacy.\n\n\nThere's an app for that -\n\nThis is a good spot to be aware of the apps and websites you use and how they treat your data. Because we're talking about trusting each app/website individually, you should be conscious about what data you share with each of them. For example, when you use a website, the website only gets the data the browser is able to share with your permission - your IP address, your browser version, your geo-location (they'll have to ask you for it first), your Internet service provider etc. Not a lot more. But when you use the same company's app, they instantly get access to a lot more. Which is why almost every other website asks you to install their app. Some companies even reduce functionalities of their mobile website so that you are forced to install their app (Yes, I'm looking at you Zomato).\n\nBut there are still some companies that are acting considerate and lets you use their mobile website almost at par with their app. E.g. Instagram, Ola, Scripbox etc. And a lot more. When you open a site on your mobile browser, look for the \"Add to home page\" button for that website. It's a technique called Progressive Web App (PWA) that lets you run a browser tab as a standalone app. And it still abides by the permission provided by the browser.\n\nBut as we cannot avoid installing the apps sometime, we need to be vigilant about it. Don't install apps that -\n\n * have low rating on the app store\n * build by a developer who looks shady or has a bad history\n * relies heavily on ads without a way to turn them off, which could be by buying the app\n * asks for permissions that are unnecessary to the functionality of the app. E.g. - Why does the Hotstar app need access to your camera, contacts, location, microphone, and also see a list of the other apps you have installed? You just want to watch your favorite series. Do you really have to give away this much data just for that?\n\nIt's good that a lot more people are talking about privacy now. And the discussions should include these questions. If you reject these malpractices of these apps, they will change. They do these things because we're OK with them.\n\n\nAds, ads, everywhere -\n\nOne topic related to Facebook that shows up a lot, is advertisements. Ads are the bane of the Internet. To such a level that the brightest minds of our time are being paid toppest dollar just to figure out how to show you more relevant ads.\n\nAds don't just tell you about an irrelevant product you don't want to buy, they also track you. They track that you saw that ad, from where, at what time, from what IP address, and if they can link you to your account details, then they link all that data to your demographic, as in, that people who look like you, of your gender, of your ethnicity, of your age group, saw that ad at that time. And if you click it, they link all your demographic data with that click, saying that the ad was successful in getting a click in demographic. Yay.\n\nTo understand why ads are bad, and why Facebook puts so much money in it, you should probably know that ads don't just tell you what to buy, ads also decide how you think about something. Be it ads on TV, radio or the Internet. Ads exist to manipulate you, to think in a certain way.\n\nYou know how breakfast is the most important meal of the day? Guess what? It actually isn't. It was a group of lobbyists who needed to sell more sugary cereal that printed ads everywhere in 19th century that actually made people believe this lie. And we're still buy corn flakes covered in sugar thinking it actually is a healthy breakfast choice. Also, no. Complan/Horlicks wont make you taller, stronger, and sharper. They're also mostly sugar.\n\nSimilar examples are everywhere. No, using fairness cream doesn't make you successful in life. No, using that particular brand of paint doesn't save your house from rain. No, using that detergent doesn't make your clothes more white than others. No, that brand of oil is not healthier than the other brands of same oil. No, despite what ads show you all the time, mothers don't belong in the kitchen. Yet, ads have been successful for decades in making us believe all that. You'd still buy a brand name that you've heard most. You'd still buy fairness cream because it gives you confidence, as ads have made you believe. And women can't seem to get rid of the stereotype of belonging in kitchen for some reason. hint hint (This is a broad topic, but do keep an eye on how our media/ads portray traditional gender roles around us)\n\nWe believe what we see around us. If you continuously see posts and ads that says X is good/bad, you're more likely to believe it even if you don't realize why. Most of us humans are driven by trends. We're more likely to believe what our social circle is talking about, without thinking critically about it.\n\nThese are all examples of TV/radio ads. It's even worse when it comes to online ads. Because almost anyone can post ads anywhere online for very little money. And can manipulate you however they want. Facebook, for years, has actively denied taking down ads that spread misinformation to manipulate people. And it's not just in US. There is a reason that political parties in our country as well spend crores on ads on Facebook. Because it works.\n\nAnd it's not just ads. Facebook manipulates your timeline to show you only certain types of posts. Usually posts that make you react, irrespective of if it's in a positive or negative way. When you spend all your day looking at ads and a hand crafted stream of information, it's really easy to manipulate how you think about something.\n\nNext time you ask for that particular brand of product from a store, ask yourself, why did you choose that brand and no all the others? There is a good chance that they're all the same. They're all manufactured by the same company somewhere, and then rebranded and kept in front of you in different packaging. And yet you picked one particular brand and not the others. Why?\n\nI'm not sure if I was convincing enough about how bad ads are. But if you agree, then here is my suggestion - do everything you can to block ads on the Internet. Thanks me later.\n\nThere are several ways you can block almost all the ads on the Internet. Making a list of things you can do based on your platform/usage of the Internet -\n\n * Desktop browser - Use ublock origin browser extension. It's available for all major web browsers.\n * Android/iOS - Use Blokada. It's available on F-droid as well.\n * If you control a wifi network that several people connect to, you can get a Raspberry Pi, and install Pi-hole on it. Pi-hole can block ads on all the devices connected to the same wifi network without any extra effort on any of the devices(e.g. phones, tablets, laptops, desktops, TV etc).\n * You can also use a service like nextdns. It helps you block ads by using their DNS servers.\n\nThis is what my Pi-hole looks like -\n\nAnd this is the pi-hole dashboard -\n\nThis is the amount of junk we face everyday on the Internet. Do something about it. Trust me, Internet will feel much more refreshing, and better without ads. (BTW, you can use any of these options to block all of Facebook's urls. Nothing from Facebook will load on any of your devices. To Facebook, it'll seem like you've disappeared from the Internet.)\n\n\nCaring about privacy -\n\nCaring about your privacy is a journey. Don't expect to achieve what you want on a day. It'll take time to get there. But as long as you think about your privacy, you'll be in much better position than a lot of others.\n\nLet me know what you think. You can tweet me.

Now reload your site, and you'll see that all your hyperlinks have changed and now passes through the redirect.php file and gives you an extra hit every time you click a link.\n\nEnjoy. :D","feature_image":null,"featured":0,"type":"post","status":"published","locale":null,"visibility":"public","email_recipient_filter":"none","created_at":"2010-08-21 18:30:00","updated_at":"2022-02-18 06:50:08","published_at":"2010-08-21 18:30:00","custom_excerpt":null,"codeinjection_head":null,"codeinjection_foot":null,"custom_template":null,"canonical_url":null,"newsletter_id":null},{"id":"637cedee2630b60210f623d0","uuid":"7ae11215-e5d5-43c3-8ea1-d42d1e2b888a","title":"URL Shortening at your finger tip. :)","slug":"url-shortening-at-your-finger-tip","mobiledoc":"{\"version\":\"0.3.1\",\"atoms\":[],\"cards\":[[\"html\",{\"html\":\"I dunno about you guys, but I was getting weary of all the url shorteners that has grown like weeds around us..

See, I don't really need to calculate typos of all possible words, I only needed to calculate them for all the words that people mis-spell most. I didn't actually go look for a dataset of most misspelt words though. I decided to keep it organic. So each time you lookup a typo, it finds you the right words, but at the same time, it starts a background process that calculates and stores all possible typos for all those words. So this doesn't overwhelm me and happens on it's own. And each tiem you look up a typo, I lookup the database for that typo. So if anyone searched for the same typo, the words related to it are already linked to it in the database, and you get the results rather quickly.</p><p>Now, after all this, when I show you the probable words you might be trying to type, I preferably need to rank them.

Interviews have always been a weak spot for me, and I am not particularly bright when it comes to hardcore coding assignments. So I took this book as an opportunity to improve myself a bit.\n\nThe book has a section called \"Design Problems\" where there are few systems that you have to design as an exercise. First of them is a spelling checker. I took it up and read the clues provided by them, and thought, let's try to build one as an exercise.\n\nTheir clue/solution explains the typical issues with building a spell checker, and provides few ways to achieve/improve such a system.\n\n\nSolution\n\nThe most basic solution that comes to mind is that have a list of all the words in the given language, and find all the words that have a Levenshtein distance of <= 2 from the given typo. Assuming that the typo is at most 2 characters off from the intended word.\n\n\nProblem with the Solution\n\nSuch a search is expensive to say the least. English language has around ~520,000 words according to Wikipedia. I downloaded a list of about ~370,000 words. Calculating Levenshtein distance with all of them for every single given typo, will not be pleasant.\n\n\nOptimizing the solution\n\nMy first thought was on how I could eliminate the lookup with a list of 370,000 strings.\n\nIn my experience, typos tend to have same or similar length of the original word. They can be off by 1-2 characters if the person does not know the exact spelling. So, I could improve the number of lookups by pre-calculating the length of all the words in the dictionary, and store them along with the words, and before looking up all the words in the list, I could filter the list by only picking words that are 0-2 characters off in length from the typo words.\n\nI imported that whole list of ~370,000 words to a postgres table, and calculated and stored their lengths with them. Here is the distribution of lengths in there -\n\nspellchecker=# select length, count(*) as num from word group by length order by num desc;\n length |  num\n--------+-------\n      9 | 53402\n      8 | 51627\n     10 | 45872\n      7 | 41998\n     11 | 37539\n      6 | 29874\n     12 | 29125\n     13 | 20944\n      5 | 15918\n     14 | 14149\n     15 |  8846\n      4 |  7186\n     16 |  5182\n     17 |  2967\n      3 |  2130\n     18 |  1471\n     19 |   760\n      2 |   427\n     20 |   359\n     21 |   168\n     22 |    74\n     23 |    31\n     24 |    12\n     25 |     8\n     27 |     3\n     28 |     2\n     29 |     2\n     31 |     1\n(28 rows)\n\n\n\nSo if the typo is 5 character long, now the lookup will be run on about ~43,000 words, which is not great, but definitely an improvement. Now, we need to think about the words we'll look up against that list.\n\nAs part of implementing this, I wrote a small function that, given a typo, would change 1-2 characters in it with another character in the alphabet, and generate another typo, or a valid word, which could be the word the user wanted to type. But that list is massive. Looking that up against another massive list is not what we want. So that means that there is some more optimization possible here.\n\nIt's indeed possible that someone types pebple when they meant to write people, but the probability of that happening is actually pretty low. Guess why? It's because of the keyboard we use. While there are of course tons of keyboard layouts, but most people use QWERTY layout, and that's good enough for my spell checker, because I need to think more about my bigger chunk of users. I could think about all the keyboard layouts out there, but the complication I'll have to integrate for those fraction of Dvorak or Colemak layout users didn't make sense for the first version. I'll get back to them later.\n\nSo next I wrote a small adjacency matrix of all the characters in a QWERTY keyboard.\n\nqwerty_adj_graph = {\n    \"0\": [\"i\", \"p\", \"o\"],\n    \"1\": [\"q\"],\n    \"2\": [\"w\", \"q\"],\n    \"3\": [\"e\", \"w\"],\n    \"4\": [\"r\", \"e\"],\n    \"5\": [\"t\", \"r\"],\n    \"6\": [\"y\", \"t\"],\n    \"7\": [\"u\", \"y\"],\n    \"8\": [\"i\", \"u\"],\n    \"9\": [\"o\", \"i\"],\n    \"a\": [\"q\", \"w\", \"s\", \"u\", \"z\"],\n    \"b\": [\"v\", \"g\", \"h\", \"n\"],\n    \"c\": [\"x\", \"d\", \"f\", \"v\"],\n    \"d\": [\"s\", \"e\", \"r\", \"f\", \"c\", \"x\"],\n    \"e\": [\"w\", \"r\", \"d\", \"s\", \"i\"],\n    \"f\": [\"d\", \"r\", \"t\", \"g\", \"v\", \"c\"],\n    \"g\": [\"f\", \"t\", \"y\", \"h\", \"b\", \"v\"],\n    \"h\": [\"g\", \"y\", \"u\", \"j\", \"n\", \"b\"],\n    \"i\": [\"u\", \"e\", \"o\", \"k\", \"j\", \"y\"],\n    \"j\": [\"h\", \"u\", \"i\", \"k\", \"m\", \"n\"],\n    \"k\": [\"j\", \"i\", \"o\", \"l\", \"m\"],\n    \"l\": [\"k\", \"o\", \"p\"],\n    \"m\": [\"n\", \"j\", \"k\"],\n    \"n\": [\"b\", \"h\", \"j\", \"m\"],\n    \"o\": [\"i\", \"p\", \"l\", \"k\"],\n    \"p\": [\"o\", \"l\"],\n    \"q\": [\"w\", \"a\"],\n    \"r\": [\"e\", \"t\", \"f\", \"d\"],\n    \"s\": [\"a\", \"w\", \"e\", \"d\", \"x\", \"z\"],\n    \"t\": [\"r\", \"y\", \"g\", \"f\"],\n    \"u\": [\"y\", \"i\", \"j\", \"h\"],\n    \"v\": [\"c\", \"f\", \"g\", \"b\"],\n    \"w\": [\"q\", \"e\", \"s\", \"a\"],\n    \"x\": [\"z\", \"s\", \"d\", \"c\"],\n    \"y\": [\"t\", \"u\", \"h\", \"g\", \"i\"],\n    \"z\": [\"a\", \"s\", \"x\"],\n}\n\nI am only checking for alpha-numeric characters in the typo and replacing them with only letters. I could also add checks for special characters, I chose not to for this version. This could be improved.\n\nSo now, when I generate possible words by exchanging letters in a typo, I don't replace all letters in the typo, with all the letters in the alphabet. I just pick the letters that are closer to the given letter in the typo. Because it's more probable for someone to type peiple when they mean people, because o and i are right next to each other. This also considers the fact that we type on our phones a lot, and our phone keyboards are tiny, and we have fat fingers.\n\nMy typo calculation function looks something like this now -\n\ndef get_typos(word):\n    sample = list(word)\n    sample_len = len(sample)\n    typos = []\n\n    typo_indices = list(range(sample_len)) + list(\n        combinations(range(sample_len), 2)\n    )\n    for typo_idx in typo_indices:\n        if type(typo_idx) == int:\n            present_char = sample[typo_idx]\n            alphabet = qwerty_adj_graph.get(present_char, present_char)\n            for c in alphabet:\n                sample_copy = sample.copy()\n                sample_copy[typo_idx] = c\n                if sample_copy != sample and sample_copy not in typos:\n                    typos.append(sample_copy.copy())\n        elif type(typo_idx) == tuple:\n            idx1, idx2 = typo_idx\n            for c in qwerty_adj_graph.get(sample[idx1], sample[idx1]):\n                sample_copy = sample.copy()\n                sample_copy[idx1] = c\n                for c2 in qwerty_adj_graph.get(sample[idx2], sample[idx2]):\n                    sample_copy[idx2] = c2\n                    if sample_copy != sample and sample_copy not in typos:\n                        typos.append(sample_copy.copy())\n    typos_final = [\"\".join(typo) for typo in typos]\n    return typos_final\n\ntypo_indices contains a list of either integers or pairs of integers. They are essentially indices in the typo string that can be replaced with an adjacent letter to create a typo. The pair of indices indicate that those 2 letters need to be replaced. I did this to easily replace the letters in the typo.\n\nSo, now it behaves like this -\n\n>>> print(get_typos('peiple'))\n['oeiple', 'leiple', 'pwiple', 'priple', 'pdiple', 'psiple', 'piiple', 'peuple', 'peeple', 'people', 'pekple', 'pejple', 'peyple', 'peiole', 'peille', 'peipke', 'peipoe', 'peippe', 'peiplw', 'peiplr', 'peipld', 'peipls', 'peipli', 'owiple', 'oriple', 'odiple', 'osiple', 'oiiple', 'lwiple', 'lriple', 'ldiple', 'lsiple', 'liiple', 'oeuple', 'oeeple', 'oeople', 'oekple', 'oejple', 'oeyple', 'leuple', 'leeple', 'leople', 'lekple', 'lejple', 'leyple', 'oeiole', 'oeille', 'leiole', 'leille', 'oeipke', 'oeipoe', 'oeippe', 'leipke', 'leipoe', 'leippe', 'oeiplw', 'oeiplr', 'oeipld', 'oeipls', 'oeipli', 'leiplw', 'leiplr', 'leipld', 'leipls', 'leipli', 'pwuple', 'pweple', 'pwople', 'pwkple', 'pwjple', 'pwyple', 'pruple', 'preple', 'prople', 'prkple', 'prjple', 'pryple', 'pduple', 'pdeple', 'pdople', 'pdkple', 'pdjple', 'pdyple', 'psuple', 'pseple', 'psople', 'pskple', 'psjple', 'psyple', 'piuple', 'pieple', 'piople', 'pikple', 'pijple', 'piyple', 'pwiole', 'pwille', 'priole', 'prille', 'pdiole', 'pdille', 'psiole', 'psille', 'piiole', 'piille', 'pwipke', 'pwipoe', 'pwippe', 'pripke', 'pripoe', 'prippe', 'pdipke', 'pdipoe', 'pdippe', 'psipke', 'psipoe', 'psippe', 'piipke', 'piipoe', 'piippe', 'pwiplw', 'pwiplr', 'pwipld', 'pwipls', 'pwipli', 'priplw', 'priplr', 'pripld', 'pripls', 'pripli', 'pdiplw', 'pdiplr', 'pdipld', 'pdipls', 'pdipli', 'psiplw', 'psiplr', 'psipld', 'psipls', 'psipli', 'piiplw', 'piiplr', 'piipld', 'piipls', 'piipli', 'peuole', 'peulle', 'peeole', 'peelle', 'peoole', 'peolle', 'pekole', 'peklle', 'pejole', 'pejlle', 'peyole', 'peylle', 'peupke', 'peupoe', 'peuppe', 'peepke', 'peepoe', 'peeppe', 'peopke', 'peopoe', 'peoppe', 'pekpke', 'pekpoe', 'pekppe', 'pejpke', 'pejpoe', 'pejppe', 'peypke', 'peypoe', 'peyppe', 'peuplw', 'peuplr', 'peupld', 'peupls', 'peupli', 'peeplw', 'peeplr', 'peepld', 'peepls', 'peepli', 'peoplw', 'peoplr', 'peopld', 'peopls', 'peopli', 'pekplw', 'pekplr', 'pekpld', 'pekpls', 'pekpli', 'pejplw', 'pejplr', 'pejpld', 'pejpls', 'pejpli', 'peyplw', 'peyplr', 'peypld', 'peypls', 'peypli', 'peioke', 'peiooe', 'peiope', 'peilke', 'peiloe', 'peilpe', 'peiolw', 'peiolr', 'peiold', 'peiols', 'peioli', 'peillw', 'peillr', 'peilld', 'peills', 'peilli', 'peipkw', 'peipkr', 'peipkd', 'peipks', 'peipki', 'peipow', 'peipor', 'peipod', 'peipos', 'peipoi', 'peippw', 'peippr', 'peippd', 'peipps', 'peippi']\n\nSo at this point, if you give a typo word, I create a list of possible words by replacing the letters in it with their adjacent letters, and then lookup those words in the list of words of similar lengths. Among all these words, only people is a valid word, so that gets returned in the end.\n\nThat all sounds fine. By doing all that every time have their own costs. So I thought why not have a hash table of all possible typos for all possible words? That could remove all these headaches completely. You give me a typo, I give you the possible words in a single lookup. Because I intend to store the typos along with the foreign keys of the valid words it could be typo of.\n\nI was actually stupid enough to try do this.

Writing this down itself took some time and thought.\n\nIf you have any suggestions or think all this was stupid, please to tweet it to me.

A Maruti Suzuki S-Presso. We got a pre-loved one from spinny.com. It was delivered a month back. And after spending couple of weeks to gain some confidence driving around, we decided to go for a long-ish trip.\n\nFew months back we went to this place called Gulakamale Lake that's in between Banerghatta Road and Kanakpura Road. And we really loved the road leading to it from Banerghatta Road. The road goes through the Kaggalipura- Bannerghatta Forest. And it's really nice if the weather is good.\n\nThis time the weather was really not in our favor. It was insanely sunny and hot. But we went out anyway because we were all frustrated being stuck at home thanks to the third wave. And the weekend we chose was the first weekend after weekend curfew was withdrawn. So despite the weather, we decided to head out.\n\nThe cover photo of the lake is from our first trip when the weather was actually good.\n\nThe first stop was to the Shell pump near our place, and got the tank full. The shell pump almost fely like a cyberpunk place. The hose for the fuel was hanging from the roof, and the attendants had android phones on their wrist which they used to manage the amount of fuel needed, and generate the receipt etc. It was pretty fun.\n\nThen also got air pressure checked in all wheels, and fill them up. Was surprised to find that Shell pumps dont really charge for it. But the attendant said that if you give some tip, they'd be happy. It was an interesting experience.\n\nThen we headed out.\n\nAnother first time experience was using Fastag on a highway. I got a Fastag from Paytm 3-4 days before and was a bit anxious whether I stuck it in the right place and if it'll get scanned properly. But thankfully, everything went smoothly. Paytm sent SMS confirming the charge within 15 minutes or so.\n\nDriving on NICE road was also quite the experience. First time I got to drive over 80kmph. The car handled it adequately enough. I was getting mileage around 18-20kmpl on the highway if I believe the car's system. Which was pretty good. I'm yet to calculate the mileage myself. But the fuel level seems to agree with it so far.\n\nHere are some photos from the trip -\n\nAnd here is out ride resting under some shade beside the lake -\n\nNote: Almost all photos are courtesy of Ayanti.\n\nWhile coming back we stopped at the Cafe Coffee Day at Brigade Meadows on Kanakpura road. We freshened up a bit and had a small lunch there before heading back.\n\nIt was still pretty much sunny when we were done. So we decided to come back via the same road across Banerghatta forest instead of coming through Kanakpura road.\n\nIt was a fun 70-ish km drive. And the best thing is it got me enough confidence to go on long drives more frequently.","feature_image":"__GHOST_URL__/content/images/2022/02/IMG20210904132132.jpg","featured":0,"type":"post","status":"published","locale":null,"visibility":"public","email_recipient_filter":"none","created_at":"2022-02-11 12:44:06","updated_at":"2022-02-11 18:29:55","published_at":"2022-01-23 13:14:00","custom_excerpt":null,"codeinjection_head":null,"codeinjection_foot":null,"custom_template":null,"canonical_url":null,"newsletter_id":null},{"id":"637cedee2630b60210f6242b","uuid":"3e2de5bc-365c-4a30-8fe0-0226a7b1c6e4","title":"Road trip to Pyramid Valley International","slug":"road-trip-to-pyramid-valley-international","mobiledoc":"{\"version\":\"0.3.1\",\"atoms\":[],\"cards\":[[\"image\",{\"src\":\"__GHOST_URL__/content/images/2022/02/IMG20220206162251-1.jpg\",\"width\":4096,\"height\":3072,\"caption\":\"Pyramid Valley International from the lawn outside\"}],[\"image\",{\"src\":\"__GHOST_URL__/content/images/2022/02/Screenshot-2022-02-11-at-6.57.16-PM.png\",\"width\":1464,\"height\":1448,\"caption\":\"Trip to Pyramid Valley International\"}],[\"image\",{\"src\":\"__GHOST_URL__/content/images/2022/02/IMG_20220206_151610.jpg\",\"width\":3000,\"height\":4000,\"caption\":\"Kanakpura Road\"}],[\"gallery\",{\"images\":[{\"fileName\":\"IMG_20220206_172558.jpg\",\"row\":0,\"width\":3000,\"height\":4000,\"src\":\"__GHOST_URL__/content/images/2022/02/IMG_20220206_172558.jpg\"},{\"fileName\":\"IMG_20220206_172931.jpg\",\"row\":0,\"width\":4000,\"height\":3000,\"src\":\"__GHOST_URL__/content/images/2022/02/IMG_20220206_172931.jpg\"},{\"fileName\":\"IMG20220206161142.jpg\",\"row\":0,\"width\":4096,\"height\":3072,\"src\":\"__GHOST_URL__/content/images/2022/02/IMG20220206161142.jpg\"},{\"fileName\":\"IMG20220206163804.jpg\",\"row\":1,\"width\":4096,\"height\":3072,\"src\":\"__GHOST_URL__/content/images/2022/02/IMG20220206163804.jpg\"},{\"fileName\":\"IMG20220206163814.jpg\",\"row\":1,\"width\":4096,\"height\":3072,\"src\":\"__GHOST_URL__/content/images/2022/02/IMG20220206163814.jpg\"},{\"fileName\":\"IMG20220206163835.jpg\",\"row\":1,\"width\":4096,\"height\":3072,\"src\":\"__GHOST_URL__/content/images/2022/02/IMG20220206163835.jpg\"}],\"caption\":\"Surroundings of Pyramid Valley International\"}],[\"image\",{\"src\":\"__GHOST_URL__/content/images/2022/02/IMG20220206162327.jpg\",\"width\":4096,\"height\":3072,\"caption\":\"Grass\"}],[\"gallery\",{\"images\":[{\"fileName\":\"IMG_20220206_181712.jpg\",\"row\":0,\"width\":4000,\"height\":3000,\"src\":\"__GHOST_URL__/content/images/2022/02/IMG_20220206_181712.jpg\"},{\"fileName\":\"IMG_20220206_200243.jpg\",\"row\":0,\"width\":3000,\"height\":4000,\"src\":\"__GHOST_URL__/content/images/2022/02/IMG_20220206_200243.jpg\"}],\"caption\":\"Veggie loot\"}],[\"image\",{\"src\":\"__GHOST_URL__/content/images/2022/02/IMG_20220206_185223.jpg\",\"width\":3000,\"height\":4000,\"caption\":\"NICE road at night\"}]],\"markups\":[[\"a\",[\"href\",\"__GHOST_URL__/road-trip-to-gulakamale-lake/\"]],[\"a\",[\"href\",\"https://goo.gl/maps/7bB7wfSD9m6UkbLh9\"]]],\"sections\":[[1,\"p\",[[0,[],0,\"After 2 weeks of downtime since the \"],[0,[0],1,\"Gulakamale Lake trip\"],[0,[],0,\", we found a Sunday with nice and cool weather.

While couldn't go somewhere out of town for couple of days, because we already had some other plans, we decided to go for a day trip. None of us ever visited Dodda Alada Mara. And it's not that far. So decided to go there. Sounava decided to join us in his newly bought car.\n\nInitially our plan was to not stop anywhere for too long, have quick lunch and touch these 4 points in blue marker towards Magadi road.\n\nWe just wanted to drive past the dams and Savandurga hill, and not spend much time anywhere. But of course plan changed.\n\nFirst we reached Dodda alada mara and found that it's not a big place and there isn't much to see. But it's a fascinating piece of history though. The tree was planted roughly around when Shah Jahan was ruling in Delhi, and when Taj Mahal was built. Tipu Sultan was yet to born. Almost all of south India was under the Wodeyar kingdom.\n\nBut unfortunately the original root of the tree no longer exists as it died of natural illness few years back. The whole tree right now is standing on the hundreds of aerial roots. There is some sort of philosophical point here somewhere.\n\nWe spent some 15 minutes there. Took some photos. And by the time we're done, it was almost lunch time. So we decided to head for this place called Ranch, at Big Banyan Vineyard & Resort, which was barely 1km further down the road from Dodda alada mara. The photos we saw of the place looked good and it had good rating, so we decided to head there.\n\nFor some reason they only had buffet that day for lunch. It was Rs 1500+tax, which was a bit steep, but we decided to go for it because we liked the ambience and environment, and going around to find another place to eat will surely cost us time and effort.\n\nThey also had an alcohol buffet for 2500+tax. We're not big on drinking, so avoided that. Mentioning it here if anyone wants to go get wasted.\n\nThe buffet was massive. There was live counters outside for pasta and BBQ. We took some meat from there. Took a bit more than we should have, which we realized later when we visited the main food section.\n\nThe buffet line was like 30 feet of different dishes on both sides. And to our good fortune, the food was good. We really enjoyed the meal. We also took a bottle of Rosé from the Big Banyan vineyard itself, and we really liked that as well. So much that I bought a bottle of that after coming back home and that bottle is close to it's end.\n\nWe entered that place at 1:40PM and left at 4:20PM. We could have left earlier, but we really wanted to avoid the sun and enjoy the food. Plus I wanted to digest the tiny amount of Rosé I had.\n\nAfter that we saw that we had just enough time left to go visit Manchanabele dam, and couldn't visit the other 2 places. We decided to just do that. So we headed for the dam. It was a winding road through some villages. We saw the massive antenna of the Indian Deep Space Network (IDSN). It was a sight to behold.\n\nThe best part is right when you take the turn and reach this exact location - https://goo.gl/maps/zP625y7QiW9PBoSh8\n\nThe view of the dam from that point just blew our mind. It cannot be expressed even in photos/videos. You have to go and see it yourself. The road suddenly moves downhill and the dam becomes visible, almost as if like you're going to drive straight down to the water. 🤯\n\nThe dam's official entrance was closed for public due to COVID. There were side paths that you could walk and climb to get on top of the dam, but we decided against that as it was getting late. Suddenly some cloud showed up and essentially sun had set an hour and a half early. We didn't want to drive much longer on NICE road in dark. So we headed out.\n\nI thought the day had ended but we still had some experience left to be had. We had to get on the NICE road from Mysore road junction. And the traffic there was nothing short of a rendition of Mad Max Fury Road. Almost got hit by a bus, a traveller minibus, and an old Santro Xing, all of who either happily avoided my indicator, or didn't care to look at their rear view mirrors before making turns. Important lesson I got that day. Going to avoid Mysore road-NICE road junction in the evening at all costs from now on.\n\nIt was another lazy daytrip of about 100km in total. I need to head for a 150km+ trip next time.","feature_image":"__GHOST_URL__/content/images/2022/03/20220319_130526.jpg","featured":0,"type":"post","status":"published","locale":null,"visibility":"public","email_recipient_filter":"none","created_at":"2022-03-25

Right before we went on our first road trip in the new car. So I thought I'll make some good use of the lens and capture some birds. Till now even if I saw a bird, I'd never be able to know what it is because I couldn't take a photo of them as they're usually very far away, and also I wouldn't even remember that I saw them by the time I get to home. Not anymore.. So here are some of the different species of birds we saw during our 4 day long road trip (a blog post about it is coming soon).\n\n\nNear Pandavapura on NH150A\n\nWe stopped for a bit near the Pandavpura Lake and saw these fellows hanging around.\n\n\nGrey-headed Swamphen\n\nThese are mostly seen in south-east Asia, middle-east, and in some parts of Italy for some reason.\n\n\nIndian pond heron\n\nAlmost exclusive to Indian subcontinent, and in Taiwan for some reason.\n\n\nCommon Myna\n\nLooks like these are seen in most part of the world, except big chunk of USA, Europe and Africa, Russia, South America and Canada. I wonder why they're only seen in Florida and not in rest of the USA.\n\n\nRanganathittu bird sanctuary\n\nThis place has tons of birds that are both native and migratory. But due to lack of time, I could only take photos of some of them.\n\n\nSpot-breasted fantail\n\nThese are almost exclusive to India. At first we thought this is White-throated Fantail, but then we saw on iNaturalist that White-throated Fantail can't be seen in these parts of India. Then dug a little more to realize that this is Spot-breasted Fantail.\n\n\nSpot-billed pelican\n\nMostly seen in south-east Asia. These are big birds. Can be upto 152 cm long. These flying around reminded us from scenes of Jurassic Park.\n\n\nCattle egret\n\nThese are seen almost everywhere in the world, except cold regions.\n\n\nPainted stork and Black-headed Ibis\n\nThey're again mostly south-east asian birds.\n\n\nGreat cormorant\n\nThese are seen roughly everywhere in the world, except most of USA, Canada and South America.\n\n\nAsian openbill\n\nMostly seen in south-east Asia.\n\n\nWhite-browed wagtail\n\nThese are almost exclusive to Indian subcontinent.\n\n\nKushalnagar\n\n\nCrested serpent eagle\n\nThis was a lucky find. We stopped to top-up the petrol tank beside an open area full of green, and saw this fellow sitting on top of a tree. Could not get a clear shot because of a branch and I didn't have enough space to move around. Again, mostly in south-east Asia.\n\n\nMost likely Black Drongo\n\nThis was a lucky spot at the Nisargadhama deer park. Ayanti saw it far far away behind a barrier. Only had few moments to take this photo.\n\n\nHassan\n\n\nWhite-cheeked barbet\n\nCuriously, this bird is exclusive to the western ghat region of India! Saw it from our hotel window after waiting for like half an hour for a clear shot.\n\n\nMysore\n\n\nCommon Hoopoe\n\nSpotted this at Mysore. Looks like it's very much exclusive to the piece of land that consists of Africa, Europe and Asia. Somehow somebody spotted one in Australia too it seems. Curious.\n\n\nYellow-billed babbler\n\nHow interesting is that this bird almost entirely exists in the southern part of India and Sri Lanka.\n\n\nPurple sunbird\n\nThe friend's place we went to in Mysore mentioned that a bird made home in their balcony inside a discarded piece of cloth, and it's very fast, and wished me luck to take a photo of it. How lucky am I.\n\nI really enjoyed spotting these birds and taking photos of them. I really hope to continue doing this. I'll post photos of more birds I see around.","feature_image":"__GHOST_URL__/content/images/2022/07/0000_0000_00000000-139-.jpg","featured":0,"type":"post","status":"published","locale":null,"visibility":"public","email_recipient_filter":"none","created_at":"2022-04-18 15:09:17","updated_at":"2023-05-23 05:51:45","published_at":"2022-04-21 06:00:49","custom_excerpt":null,"codeinjection_head":null,"codeinjection_foot":null,"custom_template":null,"canonical_url":null,"newsletter_id":null},{"id":"637cedee2630b60210f6242e","uuid":"3a73a945-bbea-4f58-932c-b02a089370d9","title":"IndiaFOSS 2022, Bangalore","slug":"indiafoss-2022-bangalore","mobiledoc":"{\"version\":\"0.3.1\",\"ghostVersion\":\"4.0\",\"markups\":[],\"atoms\":[],\"cards\":[],\"sections\":[[1,\"p\",[[0,[],0,\"\"]]]]}","lexical":null,"html":null,"comment_id":"62de1dc1872a8d53bd63cb18","plaintext":null,"feature_image":"__GHOST_URL__/content/images/2022/07/IMG20220723085224.jpg","featured":0,"type":"post","status":"draft","locale":null,"visibility":"public","email_recipient_filter":"all","created_at":"2022-07-25 04:36:17","updated_at":"2022-07-25 04:36:32","published_at":null,"custom_excerpt":null,"codeinjection_head":null,"codeinjection_foot":null,"custom_template":null,"canonical_url":null,"newsletter_id":null},{"id":"637cedee2630b60210f6242f","uuid":"5a5bd645-ff3d-4496-867d-ae3a2d279e5a","title":"Celebrating 15 years of NUITEQ #NUITEQ15","slug":"celebrating-15-years-of-nuiteq-nuiteq15","mobiledoc":"{\"version\":\"0.3.1\",\"atoms\":[],\"cards\":[[\"gallery\",{\"images\":[{\"fileName\":\"photo_1@12-08-2022_15-28-37.jpg\",\"row\":0,\"width\":1280,\"height\":960,\"src\":\"__GHOST_URL__/content/images/2022/08/photo_1@12-08-2022_15-28-37.jpg\"},{\"fileName\":\"photo_2@12-08-2022_17-11-53.jpg\",\"row\":0,\"width\":960,\"height\":1280,\"src\":\"__GHOST_URL__/content/images/2022/08/photo_2@12-08-2022_17-11-53.jpg\"},{\"fileName\":\"photo_3@12-08-2022_18-22-21.jpg\",\"row\":0,\"width\":1280,\"height\":960,\"src\":\"__GHOST_URL__/content/images/2022/08/photo_3@12-08-2022_18-22-21.jpg\"},{\"fileName\":\"photo_4@12-08-2022_18-45-58.jpg\",\"row\":1,\"width\":1280,\"height\":960,\"src\":\"__GHOST_URL__/content/images/2022/08/photo_4@12-08-2022_18-45-58.jpg\"},{\"fileName\":\"photo_5@12-08-2022_18-45-58.jpg\",\"row\":1,\"width\":1280,\"height\":960,\"src\":\"__GHOST_URL__/content/images/2022/08/photo_5@12-08-2022_18-45-58.jpg\"},{\"fileName\":\"photo_11@12-08-2022_18-46-21.jpg\",\"src\":\"__GHOST_URL__/content/images/2022/08/photo_11@12-08-2022_18-46-21.jpg\",\"row\":1,\"width\":960,\"height\":1280}],\"caption\":\"BLR Lounge at Bangalore Airport\"}],[\"gallery\",{\"images\":[{\"fileName\":\"photo_13@12-08-2022_20-17-21.jpg\",\"row\":0,\"width\":1280,\"height\":960,\"src\":\"__GHOST_URL__/content/images/2022/08/photo_13@12-08-2022_20-17-21.jpg\"},{\"fileName\":\"photo_14@12-08-2022_20-17-21.jpg\",\"row\":0,\"width\":960,\"height\":1280,\"src\":\"__GHOST_URL__/content/images/2022/08/photo_14@12-08-2022_20-17-21.jpg\"},{\"fileName\":\"photo_17@13-08-2022_01-23-39.jpg\",\"row\":0,\"width\":960,\"height\":1280,\"src\":\"__GHOST_URL__/content/images/2022/08/photo_17@13-08-2022_01-23-39.jpg\"},{\"fileName\":\"photo_18@13-08-2022_01-23-39.jpg\",\"row\":1,\"width\":960,\"height\":1280,\"src\":\"__GHOST_URL__/content/images/2022/08/photo_18@13-08-2022_01-23-39.jpg\"},{\"fileName\":\"photo_19@13-08-2022_01-23-39.jpg\",\"row\":1,\"width\":960,\"height\":1280,\"src\":\"__GHOST_URL__/content/images/2022/08/photo_19@13-08-2022_01-23-39.jpg\"},{\"fileName\":\"photo_20@13-08-2022_01-23-39.jpg\",\"src\":\"__GHOST_URL__/content/images/2022/08/photo_20@13-08-2022_01-23-39.jpg\",\"row\":1,\"width\":1280,\"height\":960}],\"caption\":\"Dubai Airport\"}],[\"gallery\",{\"images\":[{\"fileName\":\"photo_21@13-08-2022_09-05-09.jpg\",\"src\":\"__GHOST_URL__/content/images/2022/08/photo_21@13-08-2022_09-05-09.jpg\",\"row\":0,\"width\":1280,\"height\":960},{\"fileName\":\"photo_22@13-08-2022_09-05-09.jpg\",\"src\":\"__GHOST_URL__/content/images/2022/08/photo_22@13-08-2022_09-05-09.jpg\",\"row\":0,\"width\":960,\"height\":1280},{\"fileName\":\"photo_24@13-08-2022_20-52-42.jpg\",\"row\":0,\"width\":1280,\"height\":960,\"src\":\"__GHOST_URL__/content/images/2022/08/photo_24@13-08-2022_20-52-42.jpg\"},{\"fileName\":\"photo_25@13-08-2022_22-11-38.jpg\",\"row\":1,\"width\":1280,\"height\":960,\"src\":\"__GHOST_URL__/content/images/2022/08/photo_25@13-08-2022_22-11-38.jpg\"},{\"fileName\":\"photo_27@13-08-2022_22-53-03.jpg\",\"row\":1,\"width\":960,\"height\":1280,\"src\":\"__GHOST_URL__/content/images/2022/08/photo_27@13-08-2022_22-53-03.jpg\"}],\"caption\":\"Croissant at Stockholm Airport, then SAS flight to Skelleftea, then Wood Hotel where we stayed one night\"}]],\"markups\":[],\"sections\":[[1,\"p\",[[0,[],0,\"Can't believe it's been a year already since I joined NUITEQ.

Both families have a kid. They have a 1.5 years old, and our kiddo is 4 months old. But we really wanted to go on a long drive and see how our baby M can handle it. And the shortest yet not so short trip we could think of is to Mysore.\n\nAs it was long weekend, I knew it'll be chaos on Friday on the way to Mysore. The new Bangalore-Mysore Expressway just opened and it's still not operating fully, and has loops and holes that lets in auto rickshaws, cycles, bikes etc. Add to that all the \"very enthusiastic\" Bangalore crowd, and that road becomes a bit risky. So we decided to leave on Thursday morning.\n\nOn the days leading to the trip, I cleaned up Bilbo a bit, got a 70Mai A500S dual channel dashcam, and an automatic tire inflater. On the morning of the trip I went and filled up the tires till 35-36PSI. My normal tire pressure is 32. But the manual says to fill up 3-4PSI more if I'm planning to take the car on highway for long drive. The tire inflater works fine but a bit noisy. But I don't mind. It worked well. While filling the front left tire, the 2-way valve I had installed for the TPMS, got stuck in leaky setup somehow and air is continuously coming out if I use it now. so I just opened it and put the TPMS sensor directly to the tire valve.

But that seemed unlikely because /etc/hosts had the correct entry.\n\nMy next big clue was when I tried curl -v localhost:80, this was the output -\n\nroot@ip-172-31-21-14:/# curl -v localhost:80\n*   Trying 127.0.0.1:80...\n*   Trying ::1:80...\n* Connected to localhost (::1) port 80 (#0)\n\nDo you see it?\n\nlocalhost tries to resolve to 127.0.0.1:80 but gives up and then connects to ::1:80. So essentially connection to IPv4 is failing but IPv6 is succeeding.\n\nI looked around checking what could be wrong. Why connection to IPv4 would fail. I found that if you mentioned Listed 0.0.0.0:80 or essentially mentioned an IPv4 IP in Apache config, it only connects to IPv4 and not IPv6. But that didn't have any way to block IPv6 connections. And my config was the default Listen 80 which accepts both v4 and v6.\n\nI couldn't find any other way apache could only accept IPv6 and not IPv4.\n\nWith that I looked at the other ways this could be possible. Which is to of course look at firewall, i.e. iptables. So I ran iptables -S, and lo and behold, there it is -\n\nroot@ip-172-31-21-14:/# iptables -S\n-P INPUT ACCEPT\n-P FORWARD ACCEPT\n-P OUTPUT ACCEPT\n-A INPUT -p tcp -m tcp --dport 80 -j DROP\n\nIn the hindsight, I should have checked iptables first. But anyway. So I just executed -\n\niptables -D INPUT -p tcp -m tcp --dport 80 -j DROP\n\nWhich got rid of the rule. And curl could connect to 127.0.0.1:80 again.","feature_image":null,"featured":0,"type":"post","status":"published","locale":null,"visibility":"public","email_recipient_filter":"all","created_at":"2023-08-23 05:54:40","updated_at":"2023-08-23 06:14:18","published_at":"2023-08-23 06:14:18","custom_excerpt":null,"codeinjection_head":null,"codeinjection_foot":null,"custom_template":null,"canonical_url":null,"newsletter_id":null},{"id":"64f74bc159a49f010d28ff8e","uuid":"8ba151d4-f08c-48d8-b3ce-ade15dc53d37","title":"950km road trip, September 2023","slug":"950km-road-trip-september-2023","mobiledoc":"{\"version\":\"0.3.1\",\"atoms\":[[\"soft-return\",\"\",{}],[\"soft-return\",\"\",{}],[\"soft-return\",\"\",{}]],\"cards\":[[\"image\",{\"src\":\"__GHOST_URL__/content/images/2023/09/Screenshot-2023-09-05-at-9.22.40-PM.png\",\"width\":1558,\"height\":934}]],\"markups\":[[\"a\",[\"href\",\"https://www.google.com/maps/dir/Electronic+City,+Bengaluru,+Karnataka/Shell+Petrol/Mulbagal+Dosa+Corner/kapilateertham+circle/Pulicat+Bird+Sanctuary/Sathyam+Vegetarian+Restaurant/La+Maison+Charu/Nalla+Soru+Restaurant/Murugan+Idli+Shop/Electronic+City,+Bengaluru,+Karnataka/@12.8396351,77.5730393,8z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m62!4m61!1m5!1m1!1s0x3bae6c8a7750e1c3:0x4a5cfc0fce5af71d!2m2!1d77.6601695!2d12.8452145!1m5!1m1!1s0x3bae116e7d4bc659:0xa130ccf7dbe22e05!2m2!1d77.7413025!2d13.0403052!1m5!1m1!1s0x3bad8fd148163711:0x2b94f43893f83495!2m2!1d78.404698!2d13.1584395!1m5!1m1!1s0x3a4d4bfe28aee99b:0xfbdffcd61b27d735!2m2!1d79.4203199!2d13.6539985!1m5!1m1!1s0x3a4da023a1cddfd5:0x5ea7ee7a0cc7b332!2m2!1d80.1234449!2d13.7242133!1m5!1m1!1s0x3a52f75e990a6643:0x9e1db03e1c260eaf!2m2!1d80.0271628!2d12.8050721!1m5!1m1!1s0x3a5363531d9cf155:0xd9f336bd9963bf82!2m2!1d79.8317507!2d11.935517!1m5!1m1!1s0x3bacf30c00d9b7d9:0x91f14e516dc21c8e!2m2!1d78.8321871!2d12.2868649!1m5!1m1!1s0x3badcd9de097b3a9:0x98c602e1ffaf6166!2m2!1d78.1881786!2d12.5555862!1m5!1m1!1s0x3bae6c8a7750e1c3:0x4a5cfc0fce5af71d!2m2!1d77.6601695!2d12.8452145!3e0!5m1!1e2?authuser=1&entry=ttu\"]],[\"em\"]],\"sections\":[[10,0],[1,\"p\",[[1,[],0,0],[0,[0],1,\"Exact route.\"]]],[1,\"p\",[[0,[],0,\"Last weekend went on a 950km road trip, from Bangalore - Hoskote (which itself took 2 hours as we left on friday afternoon 🤣) - Mulbagal (had dosa) - Tirupati (the hill is majestic to say the least) - Sriharikota (witnessed Aditya launch) - Chennai (had dosa) - Pondicherry (beautiful) - Thiruvannamalai (the town with setting sun on the backdrop is mesmerizing) - Krishnagiri (Murugan idli 👌) - back to Luru.\"]]],[1,\"p\",[[0,[],0,\"This was our first long trip with the 9mo.

Kind of like a stress test of how much of this he can take. And he was completely fine despite spending almost 8 hours in the car all 3 days. And too in our tiny car. Along with my aged parents.\nThis just means that more of this will be coming in future.\n\nWe decided to take on this journey after getting the confirmed launch time of Aditya L1. Because it was our first long trip with the kid, hereafter referred to as M, and the launch was scheduled at 11:50 in the morning, we decided to split the journey and not drive to Sriharikota directly and rather, leave on Friday evening, stay at Tirupati that night, and then leave from tirupati around 7-8AM so that we could reach Sriharikota in time.\n\nJourney to Tirupati started a bit too late as everyone was very tired that day already because of all the preparations, so everyone went to sleep after lunch and we left around 4:30-ish. It took us 2 hours just to reach the Shell near Decathlon Old Madras Road. We stopped for some tea and snacks for half an hour and then left for Mulbagal which we decided to be the next stop.\n\nWe reached Mulbagal Dosa Corner at around 8:45PM. The first thing we needed to take care of was the kid's food. We were carrying all the raw ingredient. We quickly chopped the veggies, washing with rice and dal, and requested the restaurant manager to quickly heat it for some whistles and they happily obliged. I was a little worried about whether they'll entertain our request or not, but they did so happily. We were very happy.\n\nThe Mulbagal Dosa was crispy af on the outside and soft on the inside. It was great. We had 2 each I think.\n\nOur next destination was Tirupati directly. From Chittoor we got on the Bangalore Tirupati Bypass Road, and it was one of the best roads I've driven on. I didn't even notice when we climed to 100km/h, it was so smooth. The road goes through a mountain range and we could see the silhouettes. I want to drive there during day once.\n\nWe reached Tirupati around 12:20 at night. Reached the service apartment we had booked for the night. Checked in and then went to sleep as we had to leave early on Saturday.\n\nSaturday morning we woke up and left around 7:30AM. The whole city seems like under construction. After much detour, we got on the new flyover on the Tirupati Rd which goes directly to the Nandi circle and had a great view of the Tirupati mountain range from the flyover itself. The tirupati mountain is just very majestic.  Along with the gopuras peeking through them.\n\nWe spent some time at the nandi circle. Clicked some photos. Filled up the tank from a nearby Shell. And then left for Sriharikota.\n\nTirupati to Sriharikota was one of the roughest patches in the whole trip. Roads were broken in places. Between Srikalhasti and Sullurpet, we couldn't see any other car for 30km or so. At Sullurpet we finally connected to NH16 that connects Chennai and Kolkata. We thought of stopping for a bit for refreshments. But we were getting late. So we headed straight to Pulicat lake bird sanctuary. And from here on we started seeing numerous cars rushing towards the lake to watch the launch. I guess the Chandrayaan 3 success drove more people towards this launch.\n\nWe didn't have pass for the gallery. So we had decided that we'll watch the launch from the lane along the lake at the outer edge. And my gawd, there were soooo many cars. The path was barely 2 car width and it was full of cars parked on the left taking one car width. Gonna tell you, turning the car while leaving was not the most pleasant experience. Almost felt like the car will roll off. the edge to the lake bed, which was at least dry. Lot of people left their car and just walked into the lake bed.\n\nIt was insanely hot outside. AC was running on 3. We had to take out our umbrellas to get out and watch the launch. And around 5 minutes after we parked out car at a spot, the launch began.\n\nIt was one of the experiences I wont forget. The sight of the fire coming out of the rocket, and it slowly leave the visible atmosphere was exhilarating to say the least. And then came the thundering boom. Almost as if my heart shook. I'd suggest everyone to experience this at least once in life.\n\nAfter the rocket left the visible range, we slowly packed up, reversed the car with great difficulty in that narrow space with slopes on both sides, and then decided to drive towards the Space center just to see the entrance. There were numerous police on the whole way till the entrace. Every 100 meter one policeman was standing and guiding the cars, even in that heat.\n\nFrom the entrace we took U turn and came towards the Sriharikota town and stopped for brunch at this only restaurant with good rating. After the meal we headed out towards Chennai. The plan was to stop somewhere near Chennai outer ring road for proper lunch.\n\nChennai outer ring road was nice. Had speed limit of 100kmph. So decided not to stop and cover some good distance. And then we stopped at a restaurant near Maraimalai for some evening snacks before we head out for Pondicherry.\n\nChennai to Pondicherry was the most memorable stretch of the whole trip. It started raining as we were leaving Maraimalai. And for some reason there were tons of people going towards Pondicherry. It got dark really soon because of the cloudy skies. And did I mention there is no street light anywhere in TN except in towns? And almost every single car had high beam on and driving at 70-80kmph even on 2 lane hill roads. It was terrifying. But also an experience.\n\nBut for some reason all of the entire traffic vanished after Tindivanam. And it became a completely empty route. I wonder if everyone was off to some town I dont know of for weekend.\n\nThe other thing that happened right before entering Pondicherry was a cloud burst. We were driving and suddenly there was a full flush rain. Like 0-100 in a second. Had to slow down the car because couldn't see more than 20-30 feet ahead. And it continued like that for 5 minutes or so. And then just as it appeared suddenly, it went away. Poof. And roads were completely dry. Like nothing happened at all. Fun stuff.\n\nAnd then around 9PM we entered Pondicherry. We rented a 2BHK with kitchen at La Maison Charu. We checked in, cooked some rice for ourselves, ate that and went to sleep. I was out almost immediately. We had driven 380km that day.\n\nNext day morning we woke up, made arrangement for M's meal and then went for a walk to the beach around 9AM. And man was it hot. We walked till the beach near the Gandhi Statue. Couldn't go near the water with M because of the heat. But we definitely enjoyed the calm and relative cleanliness.\n\nWe came back to the hotel at 10:30AM. Packed up and checked out at 11AM. Then we started looking for a place to eat. We couldn't go to any of the european places because of lack of parking, and older parents who essentially needed rice-ish meal. So we found this place called Palahaaram that had tamil style meals from 12 noon. We waited a bit and then they brought in all the food. They said they had sambar rice and veg pulav. We ordered some, and damn that sambar rice was good. We ordered more of it and everyone ate it till we were full. We told the manager at the counter that the sambar rice was good. He asked where we're from and then proceeded to ask which one we like better, Bisi bele bath from Bangalore or his Sambar rice. We said his sambar rice without hesitation. It was so good.\n\nAnd after that we headed out. Filled my tank from an Indian Oil pump and off we went for Bangalore. Last day of the road trip.\n\n\nSome highlights of the whole trip -\n\n 1.  Mulbagal dosa was somehow crispy and soft at the same time.\n 2.  The dosa place owner was very happy to take our pressure cooker and cook the food for o when we requested.\n 3.  Tirupati bypass road is one of the finest I've driven on.\n 4.  Tirupati hill was so grand. We didn't go to the temple for lack of time. But I'd go again just to see the hill and take good photos. Couldn't take any photos as we were short of time.\n 5.  Thanks to the Chandrayaan hype, Sriharikota was crowded af.\n 6.  Chennai is huge. The passing by the chennai outer ring road took so much time..\n 7.  From Chennai till Tindivanam, after dark, is a completely horrifying experience. Hilly road, no street light, but literally everyone on high beam and nobody drives under 70-80kmph.\n 8.  Running theme of driving in TN - zero street lights apart from in towns, low beam is likely banned in that state, everybody drives like they have to pee *really really* bad. I've driven around 12k km in Karnataka till now. This was a new experience.\n 9.  We faced a cloudburst right before entering Pondy. Insane insane rain for 5 minutes. And then completely dry roads after that. Surreal experience.\n 10. Pondy is nice. We couldn't explore a lot. But drove around the town few times to know what is where.\n 11. Pondy marina was nice\n 12. I like sambar rice in TN better than bisi bele bath in KA. So good.\n 13. Petrol was cheaper in Pondy.\n 14. Thiruvannamalai town during sunset is just beautiful.\n 15. For the first time in life saw Lenticular cloud on top of the mountain beside Thiruvannamalai.\n 16. Dosa at Murugan idli is ❤️\n 17. It actually felt nice to drive in Bangalore After what I experienced for 2 days before.\n 18. A TPMS is very useful. I detected a puncture early thanks to the TPMS. If your car doesn't have one, get one.\n\nIt was very tiring for the parents. But they dont have any regret. It was first time they experienced something like this.\n\nAlso realized that I'd take a more comfortable seat any day before a more expensive car. And oh also, the seat adjustment matters most in long drives.","feature_image":null,"featured":0,"type":"post","status":"draft","locale":null,"visibility":"public","email_recipient_filter":"all","created_at":"2023-09-05 15:39:45","updated_at":"2023-10-04
