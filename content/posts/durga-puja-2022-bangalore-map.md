Every year I try to make a map of all the pujas in Bangalore to help my friends, those who are looking to go pandal hopping, and more importantly myself. Couldn't make it last couple of years for obvious reasons. But did it this year. I went through my old maps and tracked down as many pujas as I could. Some of them moved to different venue, some of them aren't seem to be there anymore, and there are new ones around. Sharing the map with everyone here so that you can all enjoy this puja. Happy Durga Puja 2022.

I've included all the public pujas I could find. I've excluded the private pujas inside gated communities because I don't know if they are open to public. If you know of any puja that I've missed, please to ping me, I'll add them.
