Want Linux Discs? All you need is an internet connection to make the request and/or a postal address. I'm assuming you have the both. :)

**Ubuntu****Request CD:** [https://shipit.ubuntu.com/](https://shipit.ubuntu.com/) (Ubuntu has stopped the Shipit service. You need to download it now.)**Download** [http://www.ubuntu.com/getubuntu/download](http://www.ubuntu.com/getubuntu/download)

**Kubuntu****Request CD:** [https://shipit.kubuntu.com/](https://shipit.kubuntu.com/) (Same as Ubuntu. No CD, just Download.)**Download** [http://www.kubuntu.org/getkubuntu](http://www.kubuntu.org/getkubuntu)

**Fedora****Request CD:** Its a bit tricky. First go here - [https://fedoraproject.org/freemedia/FreeMedia-form.html](https://fedoraproject.org/freemedia/FreeMedia-form.html), The form is opened at the beginning of each month. If it says that the form is closed for this month, then [find your nearest Fedora ambassador from here](http://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Ambassadors/CountryList) and mail them. They will surely attend you as soon as possible. **Download** [http://fedoraproject.org/get-fedora](http://fedoraproject.org/get-fedora)

**Request CD:** [https://oscd.sun.com/](https://oscd.sun.com/)**Download** [http://www.opensolaris.com/get/index.jsp](http://www.opensolaris.com/get/index.jsp)

> Most of the distros are not available in postal delivery as it needs much maintenance.. But you can download them always..
