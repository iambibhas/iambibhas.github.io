After weeks of the usual hustle and bustle of daily life in Bangalore, we felt the need to escape the routine and recharge. The monotony of work, responsibilities, and the constant city noise had started to weigh us down. A break was long overdue—a chance to reconnect with nature, explore new places, and spend quality time as a family. As luck would have it, our friend Navya invited a bunch of us to her home in Shimoga for the independence day weekend. Little did we know, this journey would provide not just a change of scenery, but a series of memorable experiences that left us refreshed and reenergized.

## 15 August

Our trip started later than planned, leaving Bangalore at 8:30 AM instead of the early morning departure we had hoped for. We were both exhausted and decided that a good night’s sleep was more important. The drive was smooth, and after covering about 150 kilometers, we took a break at a Shell pump for breakfast. It was a welcome stop to stretch our legs and refuel for the rest of the journey.

We arrived in Shimoga around 3 PM, and our first stop was Royal Orchid for a buffet lunch. The restaurant had a good spread, and we took our time to enjoy the meal. Afterward, we stopped by FirstCry to pick up a potty seat for Mihir, making sure we were well-prepared for the rest of the trip.

As soon as we reached Navya’s place, everyone was ready for a drive to Mandagadde Bird Sanctuary. The drive was scenic and peaceful, winding through lush greenery. We made a few stops along the way, first at the Tunga River, where we admired the flowing water, and then by a serene lake, where Tazz took some drone shots. The tranquility of these spots was refreshing.

We wrapped up the day with dinner at Jewel Rock. The restaurant had a cozy atmosphere and a varied menu. However, Mihir started getting restless after spending so much time in the car throughout the day. We decided to head back home early, giving Mihir a warm bath to calm him down before putting him to bed. It was a full day of travel and exploration, and we all needed a good night’s rest.

While the rest of the group left early for a trip to Jog Falls, we chose to stay back and rest. We had been traveling a lot and needed a slower pace for the day. Navya’s mom sent over a delicious breakfast of chow chow bhat, which we enjoyed leisurely at home. The rest of the morning was spent relaxing, catching up on some rest.

For lunch, we visited Navya’s other house, where her mom had prepared a special meal in honor of Varmahalaxmi Puja. The spread was elaborate and tasty, with traditional dishes that everyone enjoyed. Mihir also had his fill, and it was heartwarming to see him enjoy the food.

After lunch, we explored the upstairs area of the house, which had been transformed into an educational institute. It was interesting to see the setup and the way the space had been utilized. We spent the rest of the afternoon at the house we were staying in, just relaxing and enjoying each other’s company.

In the evening, we decided to dine at Meenakshi Bhavan, a popular local eatery known for its South Indian cuisine. We had paddu and dosa, both of which were delicious and satisfying. The restaurant had a lively atmosphere, and the food was just what we needed to cap off a relaxing day. We returned home afterward and settled in for the night.

## 17 August

The day began with a hearty breakfast provided by Navya’s mom, featuring a variety of dishes including dosa, puliyogere, and a sweet-khara mixture made from paper-thin poha. Feeling energized, we decided to visit Shimoga Zoo and Safari. Initially, we thought of taking the jeep safari since we were six people, but the enclosed space felt a bit claustrophobic, so we opted for the bus safari instead.

The zoo itself is nestled within a part of the forest, giving it a natural, wild feel. During the safari, we were able to see a variety of animals. The tiger, unfortunately, was in a cage, but the lions were an unforgettable sight as they walked right next to the bus. We also saw gaur, nilgai, and various types of deer. After the safari, we walked through the zoo, which was more like a nature walk due to the ongoing renovations. Many enclosures were empty, but the greenery and fresh air made the walk pleasant, even though it was hot and humid.

After our zoo visit, we decided to have lunch at Kimmane, a luxury golf resort restaurant nearby. The setting was elegant, and the food was decent, though the highlight of the meal was Mihir falling asleep mid-bite—proof of just how tiring the day had been for him. Just as we finished eating, a heavy downpour began, trapping us at the restaurant for a bit. Thankfully, the rain stopped after about half an hour, and we made our way back home.

The evening was more relaxed. Tazz flew his drone over the house we were staying in, capturing some aerial shots of the surrounding area. I got a chance to try my hand at flying the drone as well, which was an exciting experience. It left me thinking about getting one for myself in the future.

For dinner, we went to Vidharthi Bhavan, a well-known spot for dosa. The dosas lived up to their reputation, crispy and flavorful, making for a perfect end to the day. After dinner, we returned home and began preparations for our early morning departure the next day.

## 18 August

We started our journey back to Bangalore early, leaving Shimoga at 5:30 AM. The roads were clear, and the drive was smooth, with very little traffic to slow us down. Around 8:30 AM, we made a stop at Pakashala in Sira for breakfast. We had poori, which was light yet filling, setting us up nicely for the rest of the drive.

As we approached Bangalore, we decided to make a stop at IKEA, which was conveniently on our route. We spent some time shopping and had a light meal there before continuing our journey. The final stretch of our drive took us across the NICE road, which took about 23 minutes to cross. We reached home around 2 PM, bringing our trip to a close.

The trip was a mix of relaxation, exploration, and family time, providing a much-needed break from our usual routine. The memories made during these few days will be cherished for a long time.
