# Bandipur Wildlife Diary: A Day in the Wild

I got an opportunity to join a group trip to Bandipur forest stay organized by Deepa Mohan and took it on a whim. I bought a new 200-500 mm lens just around that time. It was a good opportunity to test it.

## 30 Nov Morning, Early Hours

The pickup time was around 6AM and luck wasn't with me to book a cab. So I walked to the nearest Yulu spot and took a Yulu for pickup. Ananth gave me a tide to and from Bandipur all the way. The morning felt crisp and full of anticipation.

## Morning, Kadamba Coffee Stop

Quick coffee break at Kadamba coffee shop right at the junction of NICE road and Mysore road.

## Mysore Road Toll Plaza

Fascinating moment at the toll. The FASTag scanner wasn't detecting our vehicle. The attendant's clever trick? Use the windshield wiper. Magically, it worked immediately!

## Breakfast at Hari Govinda

We stopped at Hari Govinda on Mysore ring road for a hearty breakfast. Ananth mentioned Kenneth Anderson - a name that sparked curiosity about wildlife narratives. Ashik generously shared some pistachios.

## Bandipur Arrival: Briefing Session

Attended the Friends of Bandipur programme explanation. Learned about:
- [Instagram presence](https://www.instagram.com/bandipur_tr/)
- Booking details
- Naturalist training opportunities

## Safari Begins: Afternoon Adventure

Initial hours were disappointingly quiet. An owlet greeted us at the start - our first wildlife encounter.

First two hours: Almost nothing. Then, sporadic bird sightings. The bus driver transformed into a wildlife-chasing Vin Diesel, racing to potential leopard locations.

Near-miss with a leopard. We arrived just moments after it disappeared.

## Post-Safari Excitement

Enjoyed tea and onion pakora. Unexpected highlight: A leopard casually walking outside the canteen! Nature's surprise performance.

## Evening Wildlife Observations

Gathered around, sharing stories:
- Waited for deer (they remained alert, we saw nothing)
- Ashik showed Kerala forest videos
- Watched elephants crossing a busy road
- Shalini shared an incredible Jim Corbett story about a tiger encounter just 8-10 feet away

## Nighttime Wildlife Drama

Strict leopard movement protocols:
- Traveled in buggies
- Cautious dinner arrangements
- Surprising moment: We spotted a leopard cub right beside the dorm where we were sleeping!

## Friday Morning Safari

Excellent bird watching session. We spotted a lot of birds - eagles, vulture, buzzard, pigeons and what not.

## Departure and Exploration

Checked out of Bandipur. Attempted to visit Himavad Gopalaswamy Temple - too crowded.

Pivoted to Ranganthittu Bird Sanctuary:
- 40-minute photography boat ride
- [Captured stunning pelican shots](https://www.instagram.com/p/DDFmkpahw1o/)
- Explored the entire sanctuary

## Journey Home

Bangalore greeted us with rain - a fitting end to our wildlife adventure.

## Culinary Highlights

Lunch was a delightful spread:
- Pulav
- Bhindi masala
- Roti
- Rice
- Sambar
- Papar
- Payasam

## Recommended Follow-ups
- Investigate Bandipur vehicle movement timings
- Deep dive into Kenneth Anderson's wildlife writings
- Research vulture-Parsi connections

A day of unexpected encounters, wildlife whispers, and nature's unpredictable magic.
