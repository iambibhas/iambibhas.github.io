I flew back to Kolkata today. Ayanti and I came to Kolkata earlier this month because MIL suddenly fell ill. She had to be hospitalised. And we flew here in hours notice. Then last week i have to travel back to Bangalore for some work. And now I’m back to Kolkata again.

Too many thoughts are rushing through my mind and I am having trouble processing everything at the same time. So thought I’ll try writing things down.

For a long time We have been pondering about these days when we will need to run back to take care of our parents given that we stay far from them in Bangalore, and they are also reaching old age. I guess those days are finally here.

I have lived primarily in a city that’s far from my parents for over a decade now. My dad has been retired since long before that and mom has always been a home maker. So they have been dependent on me since i was in college.

Whoever I talk to always assume that i have been able to afford to live far from them because my sister lives close to them.

That is partially true. It does afford me some amount of mental space knowing that my sister lives closer to them in case of emergency. But the actual reason why i have lived far from them has always had to do with the fact that i needed to grow myself. I needed to build a network of people that let me grow as a person. Be Somebody who can take better care of their parents when the need actually be. It’s definitely possible that I could dedicate my 100% time to them, but that would have meant staying in a dead city with no space of growth as a techie.

My parents have been generally very supportive of this and I’m grateful to them. I’m not sure how much they would think of me if I became a recluse living in one room all my life. Also, i feel like they deserved some time away from their children after bringing us up for almost 30 years or so, me and my sister combined. Ever since I became a parent I started realizing the value of time away from one's children.

How timely that i came across [this article from Vox](https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/370030/advice-column-aging-parents-retirement-community-elder-care) just today in mid flight while listening to one of their podcast episodes that i downloaded right before the flight.

The article talks about this exact ethical dilemma. Should we care about our parents full time and sacrifice our own wellbeing? Are we monsters for choosing to stay away from them?

Give it a read.
