title: "Starting 2021 - Walking around Kolkata"

---


We traveled to Kolkata in December 2020 to be around our families. And since arriving, don't know how a whole month got spent. Then finally got a chance to explore the city, and with a couple of friends who haven't explored the city much. So that got me even more excited.

On the first round, we visited and walked around Vidyasagar Setu, Princep Ghat, Babu Ghat and then stopped at Esplanade for breakfast with Hing-er Kochuri, with Alu tarkari and pickled green chili.

Next we walked to Park St Cemetery, spent an hour there. And ended the day trip with lunch at Arsalan, Park St.

The day was almost enough to get my heart filled with a lot of what I was missing about the city.

I clicked some photos. Sharing them here.

Let me know if you like the photos. I plan on exploring this city a lot while I'm here. Been almost 5 years since I last had so much time to spend here. I'm going to utilize it fully.
