title: "New blog, powered by Ghost, built by Terraform and Ansible"

---


Almost every year I start by thinking I'll write more. This year is no difference. This blog was built with the hope that it makes the writing experience better and easier. As much as I like Jekyll, writing blog posts in markdown is a horrible experience. It just adds up to the mental block about writing something.

Setting up a new blog which is not powered by a static site generator is another problem, because it required the time and energy to set things up. But this time, I thought I'll do it and pick up some skills along the way. I always learn better when I build something. So this eas na experiment with Teraform and Ansible.

Hope this helps me write more. Given that 10% of this year is already over, I better get started. See you in next post. ðŸ‘‹
