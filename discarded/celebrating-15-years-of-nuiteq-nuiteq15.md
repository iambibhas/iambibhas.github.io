Can't believe it's been a year already since I joined NUITEQ. And as it happens, this year NUITEQ completed it's 15 years of being a successful organization. To celebrate that we were invited to Skellefte√•, Sweden for 2 weeks to celebreate the occasion and also meet all the team members from across the world. And it ended up being an epic two weeks. Words are not enough to explain it, but I thought I'd at least try.

To make it easy to share the experience with my family, I created a Telegram channel that people could subscribe to and enjoy the experience with me. I'm sharing all the updates from there to this blog post to share it with everyone.

## The journey to Sweden

Even though out flight was on Friday evening, Bangalore airport wasn't that crowded. The usual queue at Emirates counters to drop off the bags. Then security and immigration was a breeze because we were traveling in a group and with a business visa.

Then we checked into the BLR lounge thanks to the Niyo global card. It had a spaceous seating area and a nice spread of food starting from Biryani to Chicken tikka masala and what not.

Honorary mention to that door to the kitchen that creaks everytime it's open. And because waiters were coming out every other second, I had to bear that creaking for almost 1 whole hour. Ugh.

In Dubai we had a layover for 8 hours. So we decided to book few hotel rooms for 6 hours so that we could sleep for a bit. As we landed in Dubai at 11:30PM, we were all very sleepy. Couple of us decided to roam around the duty free areas and have some food before going to bed.

At Stockholm airport I was a bit sleep deprived and was very hangry, so grabed a tomato and cheese croissant and it was amazing. Over the next couple of weeks, I'd grab a croissant wherever I could find them.
