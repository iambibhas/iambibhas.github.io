I have a Pi-hole setup at my home to block all ads in all connected devices, and also running a grafana dashboard to monitor my internet connection. Plus I run few bots from it. I have been using my 7-8 years old Raspberry Pi 1 B+ for all that till now. And lately it has started to show it's age. I'm in constant fear that it'll stop working any day. So it was time for an upgrade. The obvious choice right now is Raspberry Pi 4.

I got the 4GB model.
