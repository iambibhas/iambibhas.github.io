> This will be the first in the series of some blog posts that I hope to write inspired by the "_I_solated" magazine by [Andrew Losowsky](http://losowsky.com). You can find more about it on this [Google doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1xeSHuLazQbi9bihZoLMKvAq4ccBj_tY768BJqWm0fFw/edit#). The document contains plethora of ideas about things to write on about this isolation, those of us who can afford it, is facing. I'll explore my thought around some of them.

## What the illness means and how we can better support our neighbors

COVID-19 has suddenly taken the ground away under the feet of the world. With one swift movement. It was so sudden that we didn't even feel it coming. Maybe some of us knew about it and what's about to come, but when you think about the common people on the road, living their everyday lives, they didn't get any hint of it before govt started warning them over the TV or by other means. One day they were living their lives and the next day there is suddenly this deadly virus roaming around and you're supposed to stay away from other people and wash hands all day long when you're on the road doing whatever earns your daily bread.

You (most likely) and me (most definitely) are among the _really_ handful few who can afford to stay home and "work from home" and stil get paid (hopefully). We can afford to stay home, work some and then watch some Netflix, play some game and still get paid at the end of the month. _Most_ people in the world are not so lucky. Most people in the world probably have to go work in a field with other people, reap their crops and then go to a market full of people to sell their produce. Or go work in a factory to produce some product you and I will buy from market. Or run their shops where different kinds of people will visit all day long. Keeping away from people is not an easy option for them.

For a change of scenary, let's keep the big picture away for a bit and think about our surroundings. You most likely live in a city right now. And while you can afford to stay in your home, most people around you still can't. That shopkeeper you visit every other day, that restaurant server that serves you food, that food delivery guy that brings everyone food when you don't want to go out, that garbage collector who has to go out in his morning round every single day handling other people's germs, that auto-rickshaw/cab driver you ride everyday, that vegetable vendor you know so well, that postman who has to go deliver mails every day whether it's sunny or raining, that courier delivery guy who has to deliver a package in time to avoid bad reputation, that construction worker building yet another buildig near you, none of them can afford to stay home. For them missing a day of work means no food for one day at some point.

COVID-19 is a disease that can only be defeated by breaking the chain of human contact. It attacks us at the very core of how our society operates. Every human interaction could be an attack vector. Solution to this disease is so simple and yet so much out of our reach.

So what can you and me do to help those who cannot help themselves at this point? TBH, we can't do anything that will solve it for everyone in the world. We can't do anything that will solve it for everyone around us either. Truth is, we can probably only help a handful of people, and probably that's OK. If you can help one person, maybe that would be enough to stop a small chain reaction.

Do whatever is in your control.

**Educate -** Most importantly, talk to friends and family. Tell them about this disease. What plagues us most during a disease of such a magnitude is probably misinformation. Educate yourself. And then go talk to others. Tools like WhatsApp, Facebook are an easy medium for spreading misinformation. Those companies themselves have decided not to do anything about it, so it falls on us to try and stop the flow of misinformation. Use the tools at your disposal to spread legit information that could help someone. Maybe ten people will read it and one person will believe it. That one person will keep moving it forward. Every step counts when we're trying to break the chain.

**Stay put -** Next best thing you can do is to stay put. Don't travel. Don't panic and head home to your parents. We're slaves to our emotions. Given a safe enough option, we'd travel straight to our loved ones because we want to be around them during a time of disaster like this. But restrain yourself. If you're below 50, you're probably safe and won't die if you get the disease. But when you travel, you could very easily become a carrier. And if your loved ones are aged people, you could be the one that carries it to them. Or even worse, to multiple people in your transit. Don't become a carrier. Stay put.

**Keep calm -** There is a lot of people spreading misinformation, and panic-buying things, and maybe in general behaving abnormally. Which kind of makes sense because these are abnormal times. I'm inside my home for about a week now and it's feeling unreal. And during such uncertain times people will take refuge of their baser instincts. It's hard to think straight during a pandemic. Maybe you don't have to correct someone on the Internet, or buy 6 ton of toilet papers/hand sanitizers. The whole point of isolating ourselves is to minimize the risk of exposure or carrying it to someone else. The best case scenario is to not leave home at all for a month or so. But It's also ok to go out one a week to stock up ration for another week. Just keep away from sick people, and _wash your hands_ once you're back from outside.  You don't have to buy a month's worth of things right now.

**Look after each other -** You have a neighbour who's old, or a friend who was not as well prepared as you are, or a family member who's feeling overwhelmbed by everything. Trust me they're panicking even more than you. Look after them. If you find some ration that someone is running out of, buy some for them and find a way to give it to them. Talk to people who are far away. Try to assure them that it's going to be alright soon if we all keep our distance for now. Those friends you've created over the years, who you care for, this is the time to look out for them, and vice versa. If someone is not able to do it, be kind and don't blame right now. Times are hard and people will be doing anything to survive.
