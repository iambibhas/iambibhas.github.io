Last weekend went on a 950km road trip, from Bangalore - Hoskote (which itself took 2 hours as we left on friday afternoon 🤣) - Mulbagal (had dosa) - Tirupati (the hill is majestic to say the least) - Sriharikota (witnessed Aditya launch) - Chennai (had dosa) - Pondicherry (beautiful) - Thiruvannamalai (the town with setting sun on the backdrop is mesmerizing) - Krishnagiri (Murugan idli 👌) - back to Luru.

This was our first long trip with the 9mo. Kind of like a stress test of how much of this he can take. And he was completely fine despite spending almost 8 hours in the car all 3 days. And too in our tiny car. Along with my aged parents.This just means that more of this will be coming in future.

We decided to take on this journey after getting the confirmed launch time of Aditya L1. Because it was our first long trip with the kid, hereafter referred to as M, and the launch was scheduled at 11:50 in the morning, we decided to split the journey and not drive to Sriharikota directly and rather, leave on Friday evening, stay at Tirupati that night, and then leave from tirupati around 7-8AM so that we could reach Sriharikota in time.

Journey to Tirupati started a bit too late as everyone was very tired that day already because of all the preparations, so everyone went to sleep after lunch and we left around 4:30-ish. It took us 2 hours just to reach the Shell near Decathlon Old Madras Road. We stopped for some tea and snacks for half an hour and then left for Mulbagal which we decided to be the next stop.

We reached Mulbagal Dosa Corner at around 8:45PM. The first thing we needed to take care of was the kid's food. We were carrying all the raw ingredient. We quickly chopped the veggies, washing with rice and dal, and requested the restaurant manager to quickly heat it for some whistles and they happily obliged. I was a little worried about whether they'll entertain our request or not, but they did so happily. We were very happy.

The Mulbagal Dosa was crispy af on the outside and soft on the inside. It was great. We had 2 each I think.

Our next destination was Tirupati directly. From Chittoor we got on the Bangalore Tirupati Bypass Road, and it was one of the best roads I've driven on. I didn't even notice when we climed to 100km/h, it was so smooth. The road goes through a mountain range and we could see the silhouettes. I want to drive there during day once.

We reached Tirupati around 12:20 at night. Reached the service apartment we had booked for the night. Checked in and then went to sleep as we had to leave early on Saturday.

Saturday morning we woke up and left around 7:30AM. The whole city seems like under construction. After much detour, we got on the new flyover on the Tirupati Rd which goes directly to the Nandi circle and had a great view of the Tirupati mountain range from the flyover itself. The tirupati mountain is just very majestic.  Along with the gopuras peeking through them.

We spent some time at the nandi circle. Clicked some photos. Filled up the tank from a nearby Shell. And then left for Sriharikota.

Tirupati to Sriharikota was one of the roughest patches in the whole trip. Roads were broken in places. Between Srikalhasti and Sullurpet, we couldn't see any other car for 30km or so. At Sullurpet we finally connected to NH16 that connects Chennai and Kolkata. We thought of stopping for a bit for refreshments. But we were getting late. So we headed straight to Pulicat lake bird sanctuary. And from here on we started seeing numerous cars rushing towards the lake to watch the launch. I guess the Chandrayaan 3 success drove more people towards this launch.

We didn't have pass for the gallery. So we had decided that we'll watch the launch from the lane along the lake at the outer edge. And my gawd, there were soooo many cars. The path was barely 2 car width and it was full of cars parked on the left taking one car width. Gonna tell you, turning the car while leaving was not the most pleasant experience. Almost felt like the car will roll off. the edge to the lake bed, which was at least dry. Lot of people left their car and just walked into the lake bed.

It was insanely hot outside. AC was running on 3. We had to take out our umbrellas to get out and watch the launch. And around 5 minutes after we parked out car at a spot, the launch began.

It was one of the experiences I wont forget. The sight of the fire coming out of the rocket, and it slowly leave the visible atmosphere was exhilarating to say the least. And then came the thundering boom. Almost as if my heart shook. I'd suggest everyone to experience this at least once in life.

After the rocket left the visible range, we slowly packed up, reversed the car with great difficulty in that narrow space with slopes on both sides, and then decided to drive towards the Space center just to see the entrance. There were numerous police on the whole way till the entrace. Every 100 meter one policeman was standing and guiding the cars, even in that heat.

From the entrace we took U turn and came towards the Sriharikota town and stopped for brunch at this only restaurant with good rating. After the meal we headed out towards Chennai. The plan was to stop somewhere near Chennai outer ring road for proper lunch.

Chennai outer ring road was nice. Had speed limit of 100kmph. So decided not to stop and cover some good distance. And then we stopped at a restaurant near Maraimalai for some evening snacks before we head out for Pondicherry.

Chennai to Pondicherry was the most memorable stretch of the whole trip. It started raining as we were leaving Maraimalai. And for some reason there were tons of people going towards Pondicherry. It got dark really soon because of the cloudy skies. And did I mention there is no street light anywhere in TN except in towns? And almost every single car had high beam on and driving at 70-80kmph even on 2 lane hill roads. It was terrifying. But also an experience.

But for some reason all of the entire traffic vanished after Tindivanam. And it became a completely empty route. I wonder if everyone was off to some town I dont know of for weekend.

The other thing that happened right before entering Pondicherry was a cloud burst. We were driving and suddenly there was a full flush rain. Like 0-100 in a second. Had to slow down the car because couldn't see more than 20-30 feet ahead. And it continued like that for 5 minutes or so. And then just as it appeared suddenly, it went away. Poof. And roads were completely dry. Like nothing happened at all. Fun stuff.

And then around 9PM we entered Pondicherry. We rented a 2BHK with kitchen at La Maison Charu. We checked in, cooked some rice for ourselves, ate that and went to sleep. I was out almost immediately. We had driven 380km that day.

Next day morning we woke up, made arrangement for M's meal and then went for a walk to the beach around 9AM. And man was it hot. We walked till the beach near the Gandhi Statue. Couldn't go near the water with M because of the heat. But we definitely enjoyed the calm and relative cleanliness.

We came back to the hotel at 10:30AM. Packed up and checked out at 11AM. Then we started looking for a place to eat. We couldn't go to any of the european places because of lack of parking, and older parents who essentially needed rice-ish meal. So we found this place called Palahaaram that had tamil style meals from 12 noon. We waited a bit and then they brought in all the food. They said they had sambar rice and veg pulav. We ordered some, and damn that sambar rice was good. We ordered more of it and everyone ate it till we were full. We told the manager at the counter that the sambar rice was good. He asked where we're from and then proceeded to ask which one we like better, Bisi bele bath from Bangalore or his Sambar rice. We said his sambar rice without hesitation. It was so good.

And after that we headed out. Filled my tank from an Indian Oil pump and off we went for Bangalore. Last day of the road trip.

 Some highlights of the whole trip -

1. Mulbagal dosa was somehow crispy and soft at the same time.
2. The dosa place owner was very happy to take our pressure cooker and cook the food for o when we requested.
3. Tirupati bypass road is one of the finest I've driven on.
4. Tirupati hill was so grand. We didn't go to the temple for lack of time. But I'd go again just to see the hill and take good photos. Couldn't take any photos as we were short of time.
5. Thanks to the Chandrayaan hype, Sriharikota was crowded af.
6. Chennai is huge. The passing by the chennai outer ring road took so much time..
7. From Chennai till Tindivanam, after dark, is a completely horrifying experience. Hilly road, no street light, but literally everyone on high beam and nobody drives under 70-80kmph.
8. Running theme of driving in TN - zero street lights apart from in towns, low beam is likely banned in that state, everybody drives like they have to pee _*really really*_ bad. I've driven around 12k km in Karnataka till now. This was a new experience.
9. We faced a cloudburst right before entering Pondy. Insane insane rain for 5 minutes. And then completely dry roads after that. Surreal experience.
10. Pondy is nice. We couldn't explore a lot. But drove around the town few times to know what is where.
11. Pondy marina was nice
12. I like sambar rice in TN better than bisi bele bath in KA. So good.
13. Petrol was cheaper in Pondy.
14. Thiruvannamalai town during sunset is just beautiful.
15. For the first time in life saw Lenticular cloud on top of the mountain beside Thiruvannamalai.
16. Dosa at Murugan idli is ❤️
17. It actually felt nice to drive in Bangalore After what I experienced for 2 days before.
18. A TPMS is very useful. I detected a puncture early thanks to the TPMS. If your car doesn't have one, get one.

It was very tiring for the parents. But they dont have any regret. It was first time they experienced something like this.

Also realized that I'd take a more comfortable seat any day before a more expensive car. And oh also, the seat adjustment matters most in long drives.
